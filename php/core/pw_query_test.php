Offering a torrent of mind-expanding ideas and information, THE LOTTERY OF BIRTH is going to make you think again about what it means to be free. \r\n \r\nIn this live video discussion<\/a>, writer\/co-director Raoul Martinez will explore the provocative issues raised by the film, his experience making it, and his vision of the complete trilogy of films of which LOTTERY is the first part. This 60 minute webinar will start with a presentation by Raoul, followed by a lively Q&A. You will be part of the conversation, asking your questions on camera, like on a Skype call.\u00a0 \r\n \r\nDrawing on the best minds in philosophy, history, psychology, physics and economics -- including a stellar cast of interviewees from Noam Chomsky, Howard Zinn and Vandana Shiva to Steven Pinker, Daniel Dennett and Tony Benn -- the film employs decades of evidence to interrogate what we are, where we are and where we want to be.  \r\n \r\nFrom birth onwards our minds are a battleground of competing forces. The outcome of this battle determines the society we create. This is a film about the cultural, educational, political and commercial forces that shape our identities, often in ways that limit both our personal and political freedom. Whether you are into philosophy, economics or simply being a better person than you were born to be, you can\u2019t afford to miss this film. \r\n \r\nBrought to you by Mangu.tv<\/a>\r\nTHE LOTTERY OF BIRTH was nominated for Best Documentary at Raindance Film festival and won the Artivist Spirit award in LA. It was produced by Mangu.tv.  \r\n \r\nParticipants in this webinar receive a ticket to an online viewing of THE LOTTERY OF BIRTH, which you can view at any time from the moment of purchase until the live, online discussion on September 17. \r\n<\/div>\r\n \r\n \r\nClick here for more information.<\/a>\u00a0\u00a0\r\n<\/div>\r\n",

      "post_content": " \r\n \r\nAustralian cultural critic Graham St. John has written a\u00a0groundbreaking study on the way\u00a0the\u00a0electronic dance music (EDM) genre\u00a0called\u00a0Goatrance\u00a0globalized itself as a movement.\u00a0In\u00a0Global\u00a0Tribe: Technology, Spirituality and Psytrance<\/em>\u00a0 (Equinox, 2012), he\u00a0describes Goatrance not merely\u00a0as\u00a0a subcategory of EDM. Psytrance, as\u00a0it is also called,\u00a0is first and foremost a\u00a0culture\u00a0that is\u00a0celebrated\u00a0through events such as parties and festivals. The emphasis here is not on\u00a0regular clubs or labels but on personal\u00a0transformation which is celebrated in a\u00a0collective fashion. \r\n<\/p>\r\n  \r\nMusic\u00a0has a supportive role here, it is\u00a0literally\u00a0a medium, a\u00a0transportative\u00a0vehicle to carry us into another realm of consciousness. As Graham points out in the intro, \u201cEnabling\u00a0departures\u00a0from dominant codes of practice and arrivals at alternative modes of\u00a0being, the dance floor and the community proliferating\u00a0around its verges, are\u00a0built according to the design of a radical utopian imagination.\u201d The traveller-scholar\u00a0St. John has given\u00a0himself the task to articulate, theorize and popularize that\u00a0imagination. Because of the \u2018serving\u2019 task of the music, music criticism\u00a0plays less of a role in this case. \r\n \r\nIf anything, Graham St. John is a Critic of the Cosmic Event.\u00a0I\u2019d love to see him as a contemporary organic intellectual (as Gramsci\u00a0defined\u00a0it) of the psytrance movement. His intimate knowledge of the festivals and\u00a0their \u2018architechtonics of transition\u2019 has put\u00a0Graham St. John at odds with\u00a0traditional (Anglo-Saxon) academia that has a hard time understanding underground cultures which\u00a0position themselves outside of\u00a0the\u00a0pop mainstream.\u00a0\r\n<\/p>\r\n  \r\nAlthough he is passionate about music, Graham St John is not a musicologist.\u00a0He\u00a0is\u00a0a\u00a0chronologist\u00a0of the movement that records and reflects on spiritual cultures. He shies away\u00a0from\u00a0taking\u00a0up the role of the\u00a0ideologist. He is not the type of guy who describes what is\u00a0on the other side of the \u2018doors of perception\u2019 such as Kesey, Leary,\u00a0McKenna\u00a0and others. In 2003 we were colleagues at the Brisbane Centre for Critical and\u00a0Cultural Studies under Graeme Turner.\u00a0In the years after we managed to meet up\u00a0several times and stayed in contact, for instance over the Dancecult journal\u00a0and list that\u00a0 Graham co-founded. The launch of this major chronology of the\u00a0movement seemed the right moment to do an interview. \r\n \r\nAfter an introduction that maps out transnational\u00a0psycultures,\u00a0Global Tribe<\/em> takes us back to the\u00a0unruly 1970s and 1980s when\u00a0hippies the world over embarked for Goa (India) to\u00a0camp out on Anjuna Beach,\u00a0make music\u00a0and dance. It\u00a0 was\u00a0around the mid-80s\u00a0that a distinct\u00a0DJ-led\u00a0dance\u00a0culture\u00a0emerged\u00a0in Goa,\u00a0produced by travelling DJs\u00a0who brought\u00a0 cassettes, DAT tapes and later CDs. \r\n<\/p>\r\n  \r\nIn\u00a0the mid section of the book, Graham looks\u00a0at the darker sides of the psytrance experience, the \u2018spiritual technologies\u2019, and\u00a0describes the technoshamanism in part induced by psychedelic\u00a0drugs. A third part describes the \u2018carnival\u2019 aspect of\u00a0psychedelic\u00a0festivals and related visionary arts. We then dig into case studies\u00a0of festival scenes in Israel and Australia (where the events are\u00a0called\u00a0\u2018doofs\u2019). Throughout the study St. John comes back to his visits to Boom,\u00a0one of Europe\u2019s\u00a0 largest festivals, in Portugal, visited\u00a0by tens of\u00a0thousands, prompting the central question of Global Tribe<\/em>: what is the\u00a0sociality and sensuality of dance? \r\n \r\nGeert Lovink: In the book there are traces of your own\u00a0experience, but not all that many. You struggle to get recognition as an\u00a0academic scholar while at the same time you are also clearly part of this\u00a0spiritual trance movement. Do you also keep a diary? Are\u00a0there things you\u00a0hesitate to write about? Global Tribe<\/em> attempts to be an official history of the\u00a0exodus of the movement, post-Goa,\u00a0becoming a planetary phenomenon.<\/strong> \r\n \r\nGraham St John:\u00a0Global Tribe<\/em> is layered with my own experience in a style that\u00a0I believe is accessible, certainly by comparison to\u00a0most academic books. I\u2019ve\u00a0tried to produce a book that is accessible to those outside academia. This is\u00a0not an easy task, especially\u00a0given that those trained within the social\u00a0sciences do not normally possess advanced literary skills. And also, many of\u00a0those within\u00a0the wider movement population (the \u201cglobal tribe\u201d) are from\u00a0non-English backgrounds. And besides, it is notoriously difficult to\u00a0write\u00a0about the vibe from a \u201cscientific\u201d angle without coming across as a massive\u00a0douche nozzle. \r\n \r\nI\u2019m not as preoccupied with being recognised within academia\u00a0as you seem to infer. Most academics are politicians and\u00a0administrators working\u00a0in environments rewarding the greatest competitors and charlatans. I\u2019ve sought\u00a0to avoid this. Most of my\u00a0current work is in fact part of an effort to move\u00a0beyond the confines and limitations of academia. At this stage, I may not\u00a0publish\u00a0another academic book, as continuing exploitation by the academic\u00a0publishing industry is not a relationship I\u2019ve grown fond of. \r\n \r\nMy writing method is like the zone report technique. Given\u00a0that the experience of events is relatively temporary and not\u00a0uncommonly\u00a0intense, when I emerge from an event (party, festival, gathering\u2026) it has\u00a0usually been the case that I immerse myself\u00a0in writing. This has most often\u00a0been in the form of blogging, so my \u201cdiary\u201d as such becomes rather public and\u00a0also a great way of\u00a0soliciting feedback and ensuring accuracy. These blog\u00a0reports have often been the basis for later articles and book chapters. I\u00a0haven\u2019t done much lately, but a keep a blog at Blogspot<\/a>. \r\n \r\nAt\u00a0Dancecult: Journal of Electronic Dance Music Culture<\/em><\/a> (http:\/\/dj.dancecult.net)\u00a0we encourage\u00a0authors to write \u201czone\u201d style reports\u00a0with experimental stylistic and\u00a0experiential angles submitted to our From the Floor section. \r\n \r\nThere are things I hesitate to write about. This cultural\u00a0movement is permeated with ambiguity with relation to the law. Electronic\u00a0dance\u00a0music cultures are by their very nature outside or between the law, which can\u00a0be observed from a variety of angles \u2013 e.g.\u00a0unpermitted events, the use of\u00a0prohibited substances or the unlicensed mixing of controlled media content, an\u00a0experimentalism in\u00a0consumption and production practices that challenge laws,\u00a0regulations and codes. \r\n<\/p>\r\n  \r\nAny researcher needs to be careful in order to\u00a0protect\u00a0not only themselves but also their interlocutors and the events they write\u00a0about. That said, self-censoring everything one\u00a0does and says is anathema to\u00a0cutting edge research and writing. Finding artful techniques of representation\u00a0is a challenge, which\u00a0can be rewarding. In my own experience, blog reports and\u00a0subsequent articles and chapters are among efforts to push the\u00a0boundaries of\u00a0writing as method. See my recent article in\u00a0Dancecult\u00a0on \u201cwriting the\u00a0vibe<\/a>\u201d for instance, which remixed what I call\u00a0nanomedia\u00a0\u2013 fragments of\u00a0popular culture and media sources re-mediated and programmed by EDM producers\u00a0in music - as one\u00a0way to represent the vibe, i.e. perform the impossible (\u2028https:\/\/www104.griffith.edu.au\/index.php\/dancecult\/article\/view\/357\/362). \r\n \r\nDo you do prefer live pieces or can't we speak of a\u00a0distinction between live and pre-recorded? Do you believe in the perfect\u00a0sample?\u00a0\u00a0In your book you describe the\u00a0importance of live music that started off with the hours-long sessions of bands\u00a0like the\u00a0Grateful Dead. The schism you describe around the late seventies,\u00a0between the analogue, acoustic live jamming session on the Goa\u00a0beach and the\u00a0update of consumer electronics such as cassettes and DAT recording I find very\u00a0interesting in this respect.<\/strong> \r\n \r\nLiveness is a thoroughly contentious issue in EDM\u00a0performance and its study. I broached this in the book, but it\u2019s covered\u00a0more\u00a0comprehensively elsewhere. There will be those who argue for the genuine or\u00a0authentic nature of \u201clive\u201d performance, by\u00a0which is often meant bands or fusion\u00a0bands, using traditional instruments, e.g. a drum kit, but as has long been\u00a0recognised,\u00a0technics, from mixing desks to DJ performance software manipulated\u00a0on screen, from turntables to DAT, are instruments \u201cplayed\u201d\u00a0by musicians (i.e.\u00a0DJ\/producers). \r\n<\/p>\r\n  \r\nOf course, artists will establish varying degrees of competence\u00a0and skilfulness in techniques of\u00a0production and performance, but it has long\u00a0been recognised that production and performance are inseparable in EDM.\u00a0Ultimately DJ\/producers are playing an organic instrument that is\u00a0you\u00a0\u2013 i.e. your body on the dance floor,\u00a0and dancers are\u00a0 responding to an assemblage of factors, associated with a range\u00a0of sensory technologies optimised for a live experience. But DJs\u00a0aren\u2019t working\u00a0alone, which is one of the reasons why the question of liveness is often\u00a0wrongfooted. DJs collaborate with a\u00a0network of engineers and technicians,\u00a0visual artists, stage designers in any standard dance party or festival\u00a0environment, and how\u00a0well they do this is subject to ongoing internal debate\u00a0and discussion within scenes which seek to optimise and re-optimise these\u00a0relationships integral to EDM event-cultures. \r\n \r\nCan you also imagine a psytrance that would have gone in\u00a0a completely different direction, not electronic (techno) but for\u00a0instance more\u00a0influenced by world music? Can we say that the electronic element is essential\u00a0or is it rather accidental, a vehicle\u00a0for trance? In your book you emphasize\u00a0the centrality of dance. Dance comes\u00a0first, it brings you in the desired mood, the trance\u00a0(induced by drugs). The\u00a0music style comes second. What counts is the rhythm.<\/strong> \r\n \r\nFor some of those involved in the early full moon party\u00a0scene in Goa, which was a cosmic rock scene, they anticipated a\u00a0movement that\u00a0for them was thoroughly ruined by electronic music by the early 1980s. One of\u00a0the founders of the trance dance\u00a0music scene in Anjuna, Steve Devas, who\u00a0brought the first sound system to Anjuna in 1974, was enthusiastic at that time\u00a0about\u00a0what he called the \u201cCosmo Rock\u201d style which, as he stated to me and is\u00a0reproduced in the book, was \u201ca\u00a0potentially dynamic and\u00a0inspiring style of music to follow seventies UK and\u00a0California rock into an Indo-Hybrid new wave of rock music, that was to be\u00a0high,\u00a0lyrical and drivey with ethno world funk baselines to make for subtle and\u00a0sophisticated dance movements. In other words, music\u00a0for beach, sun and palm\u00a0trees and not cars, factories and mechanical big city urban landscapes\u201d. \r\n \r\nAs we know, by the mid 1980s, the performance of electronic\u00a0music (by DJs) had come to dominate these same full moon events\u00a0and their\u00a0subsequent developments. Electrosonic technics became integral to psychedelic\u00a0trance as it was to all other EDM\u00a0developments, from house to techno. What\u00a0became Goatrance and psychedelic trance, which is as much a culture as it is\u00a0music, is\u00a0a phenomenon that was enabled by developments in electronic music\u00a0production and performance. \r\n<\/p>\r\n  \r\nAs key producers, label heads\u00a0and event management\u00a0in this movement will tell you, sound frequencies and scales were being\u00a0produced by synthesisers that\u00a0were not available with traditional instruments.\u00a0Besides this, it has been much easier and cheaper to organise and reproduce\u00a0events in remote regions like Goa or in many of the out of the way places in\u00a0which festivals and parties are held using DJs in the\u00a0place of bands. In Goa,\u00a0one DJ like DJ Laurent using a DAT player could be responsible for an 8-10 hour\u00a0set that was mind\u00a0blowing, as opposed to a series of bands with a lot of\u00a0equipment requiring more effort, money, energy and resources. \r\n<\/p>\r\n  \r\nToday\u2019s\u00a0festivals\u00a0are downstream from this efficiency and resourcefulness, although they have\u00a0become increasingly optimised with very\u00a0high production values, and diversified.\u00a0For instance, Portugal\u2019s Boom Festival features a fusion band stage\/dance\u00a0floor, in\u00a0conjunction with several other dancefloors, returning us in a way to\u00a0the earlier fusional environment of Goa, which is certainly a\u00a0success for Boom,\u00a0since it emerged as an effort to reproduce the Goa seasonal party experience\u00a0outside of Goa. \r\n \r\nCulturally you position the post-Goa Trance movement\u00a0across the globe as part of the 1990s post-Cold War movements\u00a0defined by their\u00a0cyberoptimism, spiritual renaissance and the collective rituals of transition\u00a0and consciousness experiences. Do\u00a0you think that this New Age style of events\u00a0has come to an end after the global financial crisis and the growth of (youth)\u00a0unemployment? After all, visiting a global festival does cost money, in\u00a0particular the travelling. You could estimate that the post-Goa-movement would\u00a0become more regional or even local.<\/strong> \r\n \r\nToday\u2019s events are diverse, which is a theme implicit to\u00a0the book, as it\u2019s a diversity that was there from the inception, and\u00a0which\u00a0remains, despite industry and aesthetic formulas. I wouldn't characterise\u00a0psychedelic trance or its event culture as New\u00a0Age, certainly not by any\u00a0standard measurements of \u201cNew Age.\u201d\u00a0 For\u00a0one thing, that term has grown empty of meaning in the\u00a0present, especially in\u00a0relation to events in which transpersonal experiences may be occasioned within\u00a0social contexts, i.e. that are\u00a0participatory and relational. Studies which\u00a0perceive spirituality as private and internalised don't tend to account for\u00a0this. \r\n<\/p>\r\n  \r\nWhat's\u00a0more, in studies of New Age phenomena there is little accounting\u00a0for the alteration of consciousness using psychoactivating or\u00a0psychointegrating\u00a0compounds from MDMA to LSD or DMT, etc. This is largely because the academic\u00a0study of what became\u00a0identified as New Age was overseen by public funded\u00a0intellectuals who avoided anything to do with illicit substances given the\u00a0moratorium on research associated with prohibition. But it\u2019s also simply the\u00a0case that most participants in this movement won\u2019t\u00a0identify as New Agers. As\u00a0mentioned, it\u2019s a complex development. Since the early 2000s we\u2019ve seen the\u00a0development of \u201cdark\u201d\u00a0styles of trance which now dominate the nightscapes of\u00a0festivals and which now even have exclusive festivals. Sometimes rather\u00a0brutal\u00a0in aesthetic, these styles are rooted in gothic sensibilities some of which\u00a0steer a great distance from the progressive and\u00a0holistic pretentions of\u00a0Goatrance. \r\n \r\nPsychedelic trance is first and foremost localised \u2013 around\u00a0the world scenes have developed and thrived in local regions. There is\u00a0no\u00a0question of it becoming regional \u2013 it already is. The recent re-emergence of\u00a0the scene publication\u00a0Trancers Guide to the\u00a0Galaxy<\/em>\u00a0reflects this, as the publication features scene reports from a\u00a0couple dozen countries where psychedelic trance thrives, 20 years\u00a0after its\u00a0initial development. This is despite the global financial crisis in recent\u00a0years. \r\n<\/p>\r\n  \r\nA focused study of psychedelic traveller-tourism might offer some\u00a0insights on this, but perhaps it is the case that times of crisis are followed\u00a0by a common desire to be\u00a0together, which in the case of psytrance as well as\u00a0other EDM scenes, is an ecstatic desire to\u00a0be\u00a0altered together, using a variety of\u00a0shared sensory technologies. This is\u00a0close to the argument made by Peter Shapiro in\u00a0Turn the Beat Around: The Secret History of\u00a0Disco<\/em>. EDM movements\u00a0have arisen in history and have exploded across the world, maintaining form or\u00a0mutating, in response to\u00a0present conditions of crisis. These dance movements\u00a0take a variety of forms, from the more legitimised with a corporatized style of\u00a0communitas to the more experimental and alternative. The greatest obstacle to\u00a0these developments remains state intervention,\u00a0onerous permit requirements,\u00a0police interventions, and ultimately I would argue, normalisation.\u00a0Event-cultures of this kind seek a\u00a0delicate balance between retaining\u00a0exclusivity and opening the doors.  \r\n \r\nCan you imagine that next movement will focus more on\u00a0the economics of the festivals and have a more egalitarian approach\u00a0in terms of\u00a0the redistribution of income? Can you tell us more about the controversies that\u00a0happen now and then between\u00a0mainstream organisers that ask entry fees for\u00a0festival and the more autonomous free events? The last one sounds more\u00a0idealistic\u00a0but in fact works contrary if you want to set up a more sustainable\u00a0economy. Can you\u00a0imagine that you will paid, one day, to be the movement's\u00a0organic intellectual? I see an urgency here.<\/strong> \r\n \r\nWell, I don\u2019t know about organic intellectual, but I\u00a0have been speaking at events for the last few years. There are a growing\u00a0number\u00a0of festivals that feature cultural programs with workshop and lecture programs\u00a0which have become rather professional\u00a0downstream from developments at the Boom\u00a0Festival in particular which features an excellent and formative area called\u00a0the\u00a0Liminal Village which has daily programs for a week including lectures and\u00a0films on a host of themes of importance to the\u00a0population of an event that now\u00a0averages about 25K. This is clearly more than just a dance music event and\u00a0psytrance is clearly\u00a0more than just about music. And Boom also hosts music\u00a0styles outside of psytrance. This is why I prefer to use the term\u00a0psyculture. \r\n \r\nThe 2013 Ozora Festival in Hungary is another example of a\u00a0major festival, identifying as a \u201cpsychedelic tribal gathering\u201d, which\u00a0features\u00a0a cultural program (in which I participated) and is striving to be more than a\u00a0dance festival. For instance, like Boom, and\u00a0Burning Man, it features a daily\u00a0newspaper. For the record, since you mentioned it, while some of these events\u00a0might pay, it\u2019s\u00a0rarely even enough to cover my own transport expenses. \r\n \r\nThere is a great deal of debate internal to this movement\u00a0over a range of developments, including the price of event tickets. But\u00a0there\u00a0is no simplified way to look at it, because there are many angles. A great many\u00a0people earn their livelihood trading their\u00a0services, arts, labours at these\u00a0events, offering their services and technical support to event management, as\u00a0well as trade goods\u00a0and services at festivals, some travelling in circuits all\u00a0year round. Others will volunteer their labour at events in exchange for\u00a0entry\u00a0and perhaps earn meal tickets. Others are given the opportunity to experiment\u00a0with new techniques or methods, for\u00a0instance, within healing arts or waste\u00a0management (e.g. bio-toilets and showers). Commercial festivals are diverse and\u00a0large scale\u00a0industries upon which many travellers and those living largely \u201coff\u00a0the grid\u201d are able to survive. Within the psychedelic\u00a0movement, the nature of\u00a0this commercialism is subject to constant scrutiny. For instance, corporate\u00a0sponsorship of events is\u00a0generally roundly criticised. \r\n \r\nThere is the critique of the 'mob-driven, hedonistic\u00a0numbness' of certain participants during big festivals. The massive\u00a0mainstream\u00a0character of the festivals is certainly something that is the case here in the\u00a0 Netherlands. Is the trend towards smaller,\u00a0more secretive happenings\u00a0inevitable? And do you find the critique of big festivals as spiritual\u00a0spectacles justified? Has\u00a0commercialism around 2007-2008 killed Psytrance?<\/strong> \r\n \r\nCommercialism has not killed psytrance, nor psyculture.\u00a0Scenes rely on commercialism to sustain a variety of industries upon\u00a0which a\u00a0vast network of people and communities rely for their survival. Most of all,\u00a0the musicians \u2013 i.e. the people who produce the\u00a0music upon which this industry\u00a0relies \u2013 need to make a return for their efforts which in a world of\u00a0file-sharing means live\u00a0appearances at ticketed events. \r\n<\/p>\r\n  \r\nThe reality is complex,\u00a0and always more complicated than any one person can know. I do not claim\u00a0to\u00a0hold a commanding view over the heights of psyculture. It is a massive and\u00a0constantly shifting movement, with elements leading\u00a0in different directions and\u00a0new scenes and regional scenes emerging and changing all the time. I have\u00a0attempted to document\u00a0something of this diversity in the book. Single events\u00a0are characteristic of this diversity. There are also many free or by donation\u00a0parties that happen in most cosmopolitan centres and their hinterlands like\u00a0around Melbourne. Large festivals that charge for\u00a0entrance, like Boom, offer\u00a0freedoms to experiment, express and explore alternatives in ways that small\u00a0events that may be free of\u00a0charge do not. Are such events not also free\u00a0cultural spaces, since they are cultural spaces that promote freedoms? \r\n \r\nAll that said I recently saw how psytrance is getting\u00a0showcased at multi-genre events like the Boomtown Fair in the UK, where\u00a0those\u00a0who can afford the 170 quid ticket become exposed to a condensed simulacra of\u00a0the scene. In this contrivance, mega and\u00a0crossover events, like Boomtown,\u00a0appear to host EDM spaces as relatively self-contained stylistic worlds.\u00a0Perhaps the promo for\u00a0such an event could be "HavewegotPsytrancefor\u00a0you!" I'm playing with the phrase "Havewegotavacationfor\u00a0you!", the slogan\u00a0from Delos, the promoters of themed worlds for high-end\u00a0customers, including Westworld<\/em>, in Michael Crichton's Sci Fi novel by\u00a0that\u00a0name, adapted for the 1973 MGM film...\u00a0\u00a0But\u00a0then it might be really cool to oscillate between Psyworld and Dubworld. \r\n \r\nOver the years, many have tried to politicise the\u00a0movement. In retrospect, can we say that this is failed project because the\u00a0participants were more interested in their private transitional experience? In\u00a0many cultures spiritual border experiences through\u00a0music, dance and drugs is\u00a0controversial enough. Wouldn't it make more sense to emphasize the underground\u00a0aspect of Psytrance?\u00a0To politicise the movement, to make it more public, and\u00a0democratize its intentions, always runs the risk of instrumentalization\u2014and\u00a0eventually disappointment.<\/strong> \r\n \r\nYou may hold to a narrow version of \u201cpolitics\u201d that I\u00a0don\u2019t share. In my previous book\u00a0Technomad:\u00a0Global Raving\u00a0Countercultures<\/em>, I\u00a0tried to outline a theory of resistance that grew out of studies of EDM\u00a0cultures which I called \u201chyper-responsibility.\u201d That is, I saw that\u00a0techno-tribes across EDM genres mount vibes (socio-sonic aesthetics) that are\u00a0characterised by\u00a0a spectrum of responses to the conditions of the present among\u00a0its practitioners. Events are vehicles for differential freedoms\u00a0from a range\u00a0of conditions experienced by participants. They may be opportunities for\u00a0transgression, or personal liberations, and\u00a0they may be platforms for\u00a0reactionary or progressive movements whose goals lie beyond the dancefloor.\u00a0Psychedelic trance\u00a0possesses this hyper-responsiveness. In some cases, the\u00a0simple act of holding a party within repressive social and political\u00a0climates\u00a0is a definite political accomplishment. Expressing one\u2019s commitment towards\u00a0cognitive freedom in a global climate of\u00a0repressive drug legislation are\u00a0actions that should be recognised as political. In other cases holding events\u00a0in times of social\u00a0transformation \u2013 early Goa parties in Germany for example -\u00a0furnishes events with a revolutionary sensibility. \r\n \r\nIn Global Tribe you have not focused on an analysis of\u00a0the music. Can you do that for us and describe, in detail, one of your\u00a0favourite tracks of psytrance? What's the sound, the vibe, of psytrance? What\u00a0do you hear that we do not experience?<\/strong> \r\n \r\nYes, the music does not receive analysis in the fashion\u00a0that would be treated, for instance, by a musicologist or a music\u00a0historian.\u00a0But then again, musicologists have a habit of squeezing the life from cultural\u00a0experience in overly technical analyses.\u00a0What you\u2019re getting is what is stated\u00a0on the tin \u2013 i.e., the book is not music history or music criticism. \r\n \r\nI provide here, however, a basic description of the Goa\u00a0Trance sound from which psychedelic trance and its various subgenre\u00a0developments\u00a0are indebted. This description was put together with the help of Toni\u00a0Aittoniemi who recently completed an MA on\u00a0the \u201cCultural and Musical\u00a0Dimensions of Goa Trance and Early Psychedelic Trance in Finland\u201d:\u00a0https:\/\/helda.helsinki.fi\/handle\/10138\/34536<\/a>.\u00a0(This description could be expanded and music criticism applied to this and\u00a0subsequent developments). \r\n \r\nAlthough the sound, which emerged\u00a0by 1994 as a marketable genre, received great variation according to stylistic\u00a0 influences,\u00a0fusional developments, and regional aesthetics, there emerged a\u00a0\u2018classic\u2019 Goa Trance style led by a strong four quarter-note kick\u00a0drum pattern\u00a0in 4\/4, with a more or less constant accentuation of the 16th-note layer at\u00a0bpm\u2019s between 130\u2013150. \r\n<\/p>\r\n  \r\nProminent\u00a0early artists experimented with analogue sound\u00a0sources, digital and hybrid synthesizers, samplers and digital drum machines to\u00a0build evolving patterns with layered synth sounds and sub-bass frequencies in\u00a0hypnotic arrangements. Artists used MIDI\u00a0(Multiple Instrument Digital\u00a0Interface), computers, and software. Among the most familiar sounds were the\u00a0fast arpeggio-patterns\u00a0and strong sawtooth-wave leads running through a\u00a0resonant band-pass or high-pass filter, such as found in the work of Astral\u00a0Projection and Etnica. Early works employed additive rhythmic characteristics\u00a0in the bassline, like the Latin-American\u00a0tresillo\u00a0(the\u00a0duple-pulse rhythmic cell)\u00a0or variations of \u201coriental\u00a0patterns.\u201d While syncopation receded in later developments, intricate\u00a0triple-meter accenting embedded in a \u201cstraight\u201d duple-framework persisted in\u00a0the higher frequency layers, arpeggios, percussive\u00a0elements and leads. These\u00a0embedded alternative signatures combined with the frequent use of the Phrygian\u00a0Major scale to give\u00a0Goa Trance an \u201cEastern\u201d feel. The tracks were programmed\u00a0into 8-10 minute long pieces. \r\n \r\nIs some of this music online?\u00a0Can you give some pointers? Compilations are important, I understood. The album\u00a0was never the\u00a0right format for this type of music. Can you mention a few more\u00a0\u2018classic\u2019 tracks that you like? We\u2019re now 20-30 years later. How\u00a0would you\u00a0describe the style and the \u2018feel\u2019 of the music?<\/strong> \r\n \r\nNetlabels\u00a0have grown popular here as in other EDM developments. One chief portal (and\u00a0label) is Ektoplazm<\/a>\u00a0 (www.ektoplazm.com) founded by Alexander Synaptic (Basilisk). That site\u00a0incidentally features a spectrum of psychedelic\u00a0electronic music, where the\u00a0term \u201cpsytrance\u201d holds much less explanatory power than it once did. A \u201cone\u00a0stop shop\u201d (it's a free\u00a0download) can land you the epic\u00a0Ektoplazm's Greatest\u00a0Trips<\/a>, 50 tracks from 2008-2012 compiled by Basilisk showcasing \u201cthe\u00a0immense diversity and creative vitality of the global psychedelic trance, techno,\u00a0and downtempo movements.\u201d\r\n<\/p>\r\n  \r\nAlbums and\u00a0EPs (in digital files) continue to be a chief means by which artists will make\u00a0a name for themselves, alongside\u00a0Soundcloud, and there is prestige to being\u00a0selected on label compilations, and ultimately selected by touring DJs.\u00a0Expressing\u00a0artistic vision in concept albums appears retained in this\u00a0development, inheriting much from psychedelic forebears, although the\u00a0\u201cvision\u201d\u00a0is somewhat distributed as artists can take on a variety of personas and be\u00a0involved with numerous acts, in response to\u00a0changing styles and tastes. In many\u00a0cases, the overall vision seems to be retained, as with the prodigious output\u00a0of Jake\u00a0Stephenson (aka Shamanic Tribes on Acid \u2013 i.e. STONA) who was involved\u00a0in, from the last count at Discogs, some 58 named\u00a0production projects. The\u00a0industry characteristics of this development deserve greater attention, including\u00a0how many DJ\/producer\u00a0names in the psychedelic tradition are more than just\u00a0names, but invented personas. \r\n \r\n\u201cClassic\u201d\u00a0covers quite some territory for me and I could go on for pages, but from a\u00a0mid-1990s era perspective I'll be mercifully\u00a0brief - besides Hallucinogen\u00a0(Simon Posford) who was responsible for shaping the sound of psychedelic trance\u00a0with many classic\u00a0tracks like anything from\u00a0The Lone Deranger<\/em>, as well\u00a0as tracks like \u201cSpace Pussy\u201d and \u201cLSD\u201d (Posford is also the chief engineer\u00a0behind chief act in the psychedelic diaspora Sphongle (with Raja Ram), I like\u00a0early X-Dream, Earth Nation, Total Eclipse, Astral\u00a0Projection, Etnica, Eat\u00a0Static, System 7, Third Eye, Human Blue, Synchro (on the psybreaks edge), and\u00a0UX, especially \u201cMaster of the\u00a0Universe\u201d which was dark and brooding and\u00a0thunderous psychedelic opera, and ahead of its time (their album\u00a0Ultimate\u00a0Experience<\/em>\u00a0(1997) was recently remastered to superb effect). \r\n<\/p>\r\n  \r\nUltimately I\u00a0cannot nail it down to any one sound. But as far as the\u00a0music is concerned,\u00a0it's all about the context \u2013 i.e. the dancefloor and the event itself. You\u00a0cannot understand this music, nor\u00a0indeed most EDM sounds, through your\u00a0headphones at home or in the car. It's truly experienced as shared vibrating\u00a0rhythms in\u00a0fully optimised social dance contexts. In my experience, the most\u00a0optimised environment for this experience is the Dance Temple\u00a0(i.e the main\u00a0dancefloor) at the Boom Festival. \r\n \r\nWhat do you make of Simon Reynolds' retromania thesis?\u00a0Psytrance is not precisely retro. If anything it could be labelled as\u00a0\u20181990s\u00a0music\u2019. Still, all the retrogarde aspect of the contemporary recording industry\u00a0affect psytrance as well.<\/strong> \r\n \r\nI haven't read\u00a0Retromania<\/em>. I agree that there\u00a0remains a core Goa sensibility motoring this development across generations, a\u00a0whole gestalt and marketable format that was crafted in the 1990s to simulate\u00a0the seasonal DJ-led full moon beach party\u00a0interzone of the 1980s, which itself\u00a0built upon the cosmic throw downs of the 1970s \u2013 and which were originally and over\u00a025\u00a0seasons subject to the influx of styles and techniques from scenes all over\u00a0the world. \r\n<\/p>\r\n  \r\nThe bandwidth of this stylistic profusion may\u00a0have been narrowed at\u00a0the advent of a music marketed as Goa Trance (e.g. care of Dragonfly Records)\u00a0but today's events,\u00a0especially the larger festivals downstream from this\u00a0heritage are diverse, partly because they continue to be influenced by new\u00a0trends, including as mentioned, the dark sensibility, but also dubstep, and\u00a0progressive developments. And yet, when I entered the\u00a0chill space on the\u00a0Thursday night at the 2013 edition of the Ozora festival in Hungary, I might\u00a0have been transported back to\u00a0Anjuna beach in 1974 at the height of the full\u00a0moon. This is among the most impressive chill spaces anywhere, and Solar Fields\u00a0was coming on - good timing as I joined the buzz inside a giant beehive. Over\u00a0the next two hours a convulsive crowd orgasm\u00a0achieved peak after peak. Ambient\u00a0electronica has remained integral to psyculture and has been a chief aesthetic\u00a0in the\u00a0psychedelic continuum, since the early Goa period and highly optimised\u00a0chill spaces carry the event-cultural heritage as much as\u00a0main floors. \r\n \r\nIs it possible to compare or to contrast the Psytrance\u00a0with the Global Justice Movement (Seattle, Genova) and the recent\u00a0occupations\u00a0such as in Tel Aviv, Tahir, Occupy Wall Street and Taksim, also known as the\u00a0Movements of the Squares? The aspect of\u00a0gathering seems very important, you\u00a0stress this time and again.<\/strong> \r\n \r\nVery different kinds of events, and my return question\u00a0to you would be: is a favourable comparison required for psyculture\u00a0events to\u00a0be considered worthy of attention? Based on narrow perceptions of political\u00a0behaviour, possibly not. But then I do not\u00a0hold to a narrow perception of the\u00a0\u201cpolitical.\u201d It could be argued that psyculture and visionary arts events\u00a0represent the pinnacle\u00a0achievement of freedom at the other end of the\u00a0revolution, enabled by liberal democracies with a healthy middle class and high\u00a0standards of living. Over time, the experience filters through to those\u00a0populations who do not match the privileged status of their\u00a0forebears. \r\n \r\nCan psyculture events be the means of revolution? Possibly\u00a0not in terms of being confrontational or \u2018protestival\u2019 events, but this\u00a0has not\u00a0stopped events like Boom from adopting radical social and cultural agendas. In\u00a0fact, like Burning Man, Boom and other\u00a0events have developed as platforms for\u00a0change by hosting spaces in which a range of ecological, alter-globalization\u00a0and wellbeing\u00a0causes are showcased, modelled by and transmitted to its\u00a0participating populations and regional communities. \r\n<\/p>\r\n  \r\nThe way an event is\u00a0organised, or indeed self-organised as in the case of Burning Man, which holds\u00a0to a set of principles that highlight participation,\u00a0gifting, self\u2013reliance\u00a0etc., is itself the revolution in action. But I want to come back to something\u00a0that is overlooked constantly in\u00a0these kinds of comparisons and by people who\u00a0insist on measuring the value of psycultural and visionary arts events against\u00a0the\u00a0Occupy movement and more recent revolutionary protest movements. Being\u00a0altered together in\u00a0dance, either\u00a0with your\u00a0neighbours in small gatherings close to home, or in an experience\u00a0shared with thousands from a hundred different countries (as\u00a0is the case at\u00a0Boom\u2019s Dance Temple) is significant on its own and does not need to be measured\u00a0against other forms of gathering. \r\n \r\nWhat are you working on right now? Is my desire for a\u00a0comprehensive history of Goa-trance (as you have described in\u00a0chapter one)\u00a0justified? I seem to recall that you have not been to Goa yourself.<\/strong> \r\n \r\nNo, I haven't been to Goa.\u00a0Global Tribe<\/em>\u00a0is a post Goa\u00a0project, addressing the emergence and culture of festivals that arose in the\u00a0slipstream of Goa. I would also point out that, as far as I am aware,\u00a0researchers of Goa music scenes haven't been to Goa either, at\u00a0least not Goa\u00a0pre-1993 which is the year that key participants argue marked the end of the\u00a0momentous seasonal and\u00a0experimental trance dance era before the whole thing\u00a0imploded and exploded (i.e. was transposed internationally in the form of\u00a0music\u00a0aesthetics and event-cultures). A comprehensive history of Goatrance is not\u00a0unjustified \u2013 I'm waiting to see it myself;\u00a0possibly produced by someone\u00a0involved in that music scene through its development. In addition to that, it\u00a0would be great to read\u00a0a history of Goa seasonal party culture, pre Goatrance\u00a0(i.e 1960s-1980s). A history of the DAT and how the beach found its own\u00a0uses\u00a0for technology would also be fascinating. \r\n \r\nOne of the projects I'm involved in at present is a study of\u00a0the Burning Man diaspora in Europe and elsewhere, a project which\u00a0retains my\u00a0interest in global event-cultural movements. With a global network of burners\u00a0forming their own events in regions\u00a0worldwide, the world's largest temporary\u00a0city, Black Rock City, now has considerable reach and appeal worldwide, with\u00a0regional\u00a0events all over the world. It\u2019s a phenomenon warranting attention.\r\n<\/p>\r\n  \r\n \r\n<\/p>\r\n  \r\nThis interview originally appeared on the\u00a0Nettime<\/a>\u00a0mailing list.<\/em>\r\n<\/p>\r\n  \r\n\u00a0Image by<\/em> laurens28<\/a>, courtesy of Creative Commons license.\u00a0<\/em>\r\n<\/p>\r\n  \r\n \r\n<\/p>\r\n",

Offering a torrent of mind-expanding ideas and information, THE LOTTERY OF BIRTH is going to make you think again about what it means to be free. \r\n \r\nIn this live video discussion<\/a>, writer\/co-director Raoul Martinez will explore the provocative issues raised by the film, his experience making it, and his vision of the complete trilogy of films of which LOTTERY is the first part. This 60 minute webinar will start with a presentation by Raoul, followed by a lively Q&A. You will be part of the conversation, asking your questions on camera, like on a Skype call.\u00a0 \r\n \r\nDrawing on the best minds in philosophy, history, psychology, physics and economics -- including a stellar cast of interviewees from Noam Chomsky, Howard Zinn and Vandana Shiva to Steven Pinker, Daniel Dennett and Tony Benn -- the film employs decades of evidence to interrogate what we are, where we are and where we want to be.  \r\n \r\nFrom birth onwards our minds are a battleground of competing forces. The outcome of this battle determines the society we create. This is a film about the cultural, educational, political and commercial forces that shape our identities, often in ways that limit both our personal and political freedom. Whether you are into philosophy, economics or simply being a better person than you were born to be, you can\u2019t afford to miss this film. \r\n \r\nBrought to you by Mangu.tv<\/a>\r\nTHE LOTTERY OF BIRTH was nominated for Best Documentary at Raindance Film festival and won the Artivist Spirit award in LA. It was produced by Mangu.tv.  \r\n \r\nParticipants in this webinar receive a ticket to an online viewing of THE LOTTERY OF BIRTH, which you can view at any time from the moment of purchase until the live, online discussion on September 17. \r\n<\/div>\r\n \r\n \r\nClick here for more information.<\/a>\u00a0\u00a0\r\n<\/div>\r\n",

      "post_content": " \r\n \r\nAustralian cultural critic Graham St. John has written a\u00a0groundbreaking study on the way\u00a0the\u00a0electronic dance music (EDM) genre\u00a0called\u00a0Goatrance\u00a0globalized itself as a movement.\u00a0In\u00a0Global\u00a0Tribe: Technology, Spirituality and Psytrance<\/em>\u00a0 (Equinox, 2012), he\u00a0describes Goatrance not merely\u00a0as\u00a0a subcategory of EDM. Psytrance, as\u00a0it is also called,\u00a0is first and foremost a\u00a0culture\u00a0that is\u00a0celebrated\u00a0through events such as parties and festivals. The emphasis here is not on\u00a0regular clubs or labels but on personal\u00a0transformation which is celebrated in a\u00a0collective fashion. \r\n<\/p>\r\n  \r\nMusic\u00a0has a supportive role here, it is\u00a0literally\u00a0a medium, a\u00a0transportative\u00a0vehicle to carry us into another realm of consciousness. As Graham points out in the intro, \u201cEnabling\u00a0departures\u00a0from dominant codes of practice and arrivals at alternative modes of\u00a0being, the dance floor and the community proliferating\u00a0around its verges, are\u00a0built according to the design of a radical utopian imagination.\u201d The traveller-scholar\u00a0St. John has given\u00a0himself the task to articulate, theorize and popularize that\u00a0imagination. Because of the \u2018serving\u2019 task of the music, music criticism\u00a0plays less of a role in this case. \r\n \r\nIf anything, Graham St. John is a Critic of the Cosmic Event.\u00a0I\u2019d love to see him as a contemporary organic intellectual (as Gramsci\u00a0defined\u00a0it) of the psytrance movement. His intimate knowledge of the festivals and\u00a0their \u2018architechtonics of transition\u2019 has put\u00a0Graham St. John at odds with\u00a0traditional (Anglo-Saxon) academia that has a hard time understanding underground cultures which\u00a0position themselves outside of\u00a0the\u00a0pop mainstream.\u00a0\r\n<\/p>\r\n  \r\nAlthough he is passionate about music, Graham St John is not a musicologist.\u00a0He\u00a0is\u00a0a\u00a0chronologist\u00a0of the movement that records and reflects on spiritual cultures. He shies away\u00a0from\u00a0taking\u00a0up the role of the\u00a0ideologist. He is not the type of guy who describes what is\u00a0on the other side of the \u2018doors of perception\u2019 such as Kesey, Leary,\u00a0McKenna\u00a0and others. In 2003 we were colleagues at the Brisbane Centre for Critical and\u00a0Cultural Studies under Graeme Turner.\u00a0In the years after we managed to meet up\u00a0several times and stayed in contact, for instance over the Dancecult journal\u00a0and list that\u00a0 Graham co-founded. The launch of this major chronology of the\u00a0movement seemed the right moment to do an interview. \r\n \r\nAfter an introduction that maps out transnational\u00a0psycultures,\u00a0Global Tribe<\/em> takes us back to the\u00a0unruly 1970s and 1980s when\u00a0hippies the world over embarked for Goa (India) to\u00a0camp out on Anjuna Beach,\u00a0make music\u00a0and dance. It\u00a0 was\u00a0around the mid-80s\u00a0that a distinct\u00a0DJ-led\u00a0dance\u00a0culture\u00a0emerged\u00a0in Goa,\u00a0produced by travelling DJs\u00a0who brought\u00a0 cassettes, DAT tapes and later CDs. \r\n<\/p>\r\n  \r\nIn\u00a0the mid section of the book, Graham looks\u00a0at the darker sides of the psytrance experience, the \u2018spiritual technologies\u2019, and\u00a0describes the technoshamanism in part induced by psychedelic\u00a0drugs. A third part describes the \u2018carnival\u2019 aspect of\u00a0psychedelic\u00a0festivals and related visionary arts. We then dig into case studies\u00a0of festival scenes in Israel and Australia (where the events are\u00a0called\u00a0\u2018doofs\u2019). Throughout the study St. John comes back to his visits to Boom,\u00a0one of Europe\u2019s\u00a0 largest festivals, in Portugal, visited\u00a0by tens of\u00a0thousands, prompting the central question of Global Tribe<\/em>: what is the\u00a0sociality and sensuality of dance? \r\n \r\nGeert Lovink: In the book there are traces of your own\u00a0experience, but not all that many. You struggle to get recognition as an\u00a0academic scholar while at the same time you are also clearly part of this\u00a0spiritual trance movement. Do you also keep a diary? Are\u00a0there things you\u00a0hesitate to write about? Global Tribe<\/em> attempts to be an official history of the\u00a0exodus of the movement, post-Goa,\u00a0becoming a planetary phenomenon.<\/strong> \r\n \r\nGraham St John:\u00a0Global Tribe<\/em> is layered with my own experience in a style that\u00a0I believe is accessible, certainly by comparison to\u00a0most academic books. I\u2019ve\u00a0tried to produce a book that is accessible to those outside academia. This is\u00a0not an easy task, especially\u00a0given that those trained within the social\u00a0sciences do not normally possess advanced literary skills. And also, many of\u00a0those within\u00a0the wider movement population (the \u201cglobal tribe\u201d) are from\u00a0non-English backgrounds. And besides, it is notoriously difficult to\u00a0write\u00a0about the vibe from a \u201cscientific\u201d angle without coming across as a massive\u00a0douche nozzle. \r\n \r\nI\u2019m not as preoccupied with being recognised within academia\u00a0as you seem to infer. Most academics are politicians and\u00a0administrators working\u00a0in environments rewarding the greatest competitors and charlatans. I\u2019ve sought\u00a0to avoid this. Most of my\u00a0current work is in fact part of an effort to move\u00a0beyond the confines and limitations of academia. At this stage, I may not\u00a0publish\u00a0another academic book, as continuing exploitation by the academic\u00a0publishing industry is not a relationship I\u2019ve grown fond of. \r\n \r\nMy writing method is like the zone report technique. Given\u00a0that the experience of events is relatively temporary and not\u00a0uncommonly\u00a0intense, when I emerge from an event (party, festival, gathering\u2026) it has\u00a0usually been the case that I immerse myself\u00a0in writing. This has most often\u00a0been in the form of blogging, so my \u201cdiary\u201d as such becomes rather public and\u00a0also a great way of\u00a0soliciting feedback and ensuring accuracy. These blog\u00a0reports have often been the basis for later articles and book chapters. I\u00a0haven\u2019t done much lately, but a keep a blog at Blogspot<\/a>. \r\n \r\nAt\u00a0Dancecult: Journal of Electronic Dance Music Culture<\/em><\/a> (http:\/\/dj.dancecult.net)\u00a0we encourage\u00a0authors to write \u201czone\u201d style reports\u00a0with experimental stylistic and\u00a0experiential angles submitted to our From the Floor section. \r\n \r\nThere are things I hesitate to write about. This cultural\u00a0movement is permeated with ambiguity with relation to the law. Electronic\u00a0dance\u00a0music cultures are by their very nature outside or between the law, which can\u00a0be observed from a variety of angles \u2013 e.g.\u00a0unpermitted events, the use of\u00a0prohibited substances or the unlicensed mixing of controlled media content, an\u00a0experimentalism in\u00a0consumption and production practices that challenge laws,\u00a0regulations and codes. \r\n<\/p>\r\n  \r\nAny researcher needs to be careful in order to\u00a0protect\u00a0not only themselves but also their interlocutors and the events they write\u00a0about. That said, self-censoring everything one\u00a0does and says is anathema to\u00a0cutting edge research and writing. Finding artful techniques of representation\u00a0is a challenge, which\u00a0can be rewarding. In my own experience, blog reports and\u00a0subsequent articles and chapters are among efforts to push the\u00a0boundaries of\u00a0writing as method. See my recent article in\u00a0Dancecult\u00a0on \u201cwriting the\u00a0vibe<\/a>\u201d for instance, which remixed what I call\u00a0nanomedia\u00a0\u2013 fragments of\u00a0popular culture and media sources re-mediated and programmed by EDM producers\u00a0in music - as one\u00a0way to represent the vibe, i.e. perform the impossible (\u2028https:\/\/www104.griffith.edu.au\/index.php\/dancecult\/article\/view\/357\/362). \r\n \r\nDo you do prefer live pieces or can't we speak of a\u00a0distinction between live and pre-recorded? Do you believe in the perfect\u00a0sample?\u00a0\u00a0In your book you describe the\u00a0importance of live music that started off with the hours-long sessions of bands\u00a0like the\u00a0Grateful Dead. The schism you describe around the late seventies,\u00a0between the analogue, acoustic live jamming session on the Goa\u00a0beach and the\u00a0update of consumer electronics such as cassettes and DAT recording I find very\u00a0interesting in this respect.<\/strong> \r\n \r\nLiveness is a thoroughly contentious issue in EDM\u00a0performance and its study. I broached this in the book, but it\u2019s covered\u00a0more\u00a0comprehensively elsewhere. There will be those who argue for the genuine or\u00a0authentic nature of \u201clive\u201d performance, by\u00a0which is often meant bands or fusion\u00a0bands, using traditional instruments, e.g. a drum kit, but as has long been\u00a0recognised,\u00a0technics, from mixing desks to DJ performance software manipulated\u00a0on screen, from turntables to DAT, are instruments \u201cplayed\u201d\u00a0by musicians (i.e.\u00a0DJ\/producers). \r\n<\/p>\r\n  \r\nOf course, artists will establish varying degrees of competence\u00a0and skilfulness in techniques of\u00a0production and performance, but it has long\u00a0been recognised that production and performance are inseparable in EDM.\u00a0Ultimately DJ\/producers are playing an organic instrument that is\u00a0you\u00a0\u2013 i.e. your body on the dance floor,\u00a0and dancers are\u00a0 responding to an assemblage of factors, associated with a range\u00a0of sensory technologies optimised for a live experience. But DJs\u00a0aren\u2019t working\u00a0alone, which is one of the reasons why the question of liveness is often\u00a0wrongfooted. DJs collaborate with a\u00a0network of engineers and technicians,\u00a0visual artists, stage designers in any standard dance party or festival\u00a0environment, and how\u00a0well they do this is subject to ongoing internal debate\u00a0and discussion within scenes which seek to optimise and re-optimise these\u00a0relationships integral to EDM event-cultures. \r\n \r\nCan you also imagine a psytrance that would have gone in\u00a0a completely different direction, not electronic (techno) but for\u00a0instance more\u00a0influenced by world music? Can we say that the electronic element is essential\u00a0or is it rather accidental, a vehicle\u00a0for trance? In your book you emphasize\u00a0the centrality of dance. Dance comes\u00a0first, it brings you in the desired mood, the trance\u00a0(induced by drugs). The\u00a0music style comes second. What counts is the rhythm.<\/strong> \r\n \r\nFor some of those involved in the early full moon party\u00a0scene in Goa, which was a cosmic rock scene, they anticipated a\u00a0movement that\u00a0for them was thoroughly ruined by electronic music by the early 1980s. One of\u00a0the founders of the trance dance\u00a0music scene in Anjuna, Steve Devas, who\u00a0brought the first sound system to Anjuna in 1974, was enthusiastic at that time\u00a0about\u00a0what he called the \u201cCosmo Rock\u201d style which, as he stated to me and is\u00a0reproduced in the book, was \u201ca\u00a0potentially dynamic and\u00a0inspiring style of music to follow seventies UK and\u00a0California rock into an Indo-Hybrid new wave of rock music, that was to be\u00a0high,\u00a0lyrical and drivey with ethno world funk baselines to make for subtle and\u00a0sophisticated dance movements. In other words, music\u00a0for beach, sun and palm\u00a0trees and not cars, factories and mechanical big city urban landscapes\u201d. \r\n \r\nAs we know, by the mid 1980s, the performance of electronic\u00a0music (by DJs) had come to dominate these same full moon events\u00a0and their\u00a0subsequent developments. Electrosonic technics became integral to psychedelic\u00a0trance as it was to all other EDM\u00a0developments, from house to techno. What\u00a0became Goatrance and psychedelic trance, which is as much a culture as it is\u00a0music, is\u00a0a phenomenon that was enabled by developments in electronic music\u00a0production and performance. \r\n<\/p>\r\n  \r\nAs key producers, label heads\u00a0and event management\u00a0in this movement will tell you, sound frequencies and scales were being\u00a0produced by synthesisers that\u00a0were not available with traditional instruments.\u00a0Besides this, it has been much easier and cheaper to organise and reproduce\u00a0events in remote regions like Goa or in many of the out of the way places in\u00a0which festivals and parties are held using DJs in the\u00a0place of bands. In Goa,\u00a0one DJ like DJ Laurent using a DAT player could be responsible for an 8-10 hour\u00a0set that was mind\u00a0blowing, as opposed to a series of bands with a lot of\u00a0equipment requiring more effort, money, energy and resources. \r\n<\/p>\r\n  \r\nToday\u2019s\u00a0festivals\u00a0are downstream from this efficiency and resourcefulness, although they have\u00a0become increasingly optimised with very\u00a0high production values, and diversified.\u00a0For instance, Portugal\u2019s Boom Festival features a fusion band stage\/dance\u00a0floor, in\u00a0conjunction with several other dancefloors, returning us in a way to\u00a0the earlier fusional environment of Goa, which is certainly a\u00a0success for Boom,\u00a0since it emerged as an effort to reproduce the Goa seasonal party experience\u00a0outside of Goa. \r\n \r\nCulturally you position the post-Goa Trance movement\u00a0across the globe as part of the 1990s post-Cold War movements\u00a0defined by their\u00a0cyberoptimism, spiritual renaissance and the collective rituals of transition\u00a0and consciousness experiences. Do\u00a0you think that this New Age style of events\u00a0has come to an end after the global financial crisis and the growth of (youth)\u00a0unemployment? After all, visiting a global festival does cost money, in\u00a0particular the travelling. You could estimate that the post-Goa-movement would\u00a0become more regional or even local.<\/strong> \r\n \r\nToday\u2019s events are diverse, which is a theme implicit to\u00a0the book, as it\u2019s a diversity that was there from the inception, and\u00a0which\u00a0remains, despite industry and aesthetic formulas. I wouldn't characterise\u00a0psychedelic trance or its event culture as New\u00a0Age, certainly not by any\u00a0standard measurements of \u201cNew Age.\u201d\u00a0 For\u00a0one thing, that term has grown empty of meaning in the\u00a0present, especially in\u00a0relation to events in which transpersonal experiences may be occasioned within\u00a0social contexts, i.e. that are\u00a0participatory and relational. Studies which\u00a0perceive spirituality as private and internalised don't tend to account for\u00a0this. \r\n<\/p>\r\n  \r\nWhat's\u00a0more, in studies of New Age phenomena there is little accounting\u00a0for the alteration of consciousness using psychoactivating or\u00a0psychointegrating\u00a0compounds from MDMA to LSD or DMT, etc. This is largely because the academic\u00a0study of what became\u00a0identified as New Age was overseen by public funded\u00a0intellectuals who avoided anything to do with illicit substances given the\u00a0moratorium on research associated with prohibition. But it\u2019s also simply the\u00a0case that most participants in this movement won\u2019t\u00a0identify as New Agers. As\u00a0mentioned, it\u2019s a complex development. Since the early 2000s we\u2019ve seen the\u00a0development of \u201cdark\u201d\u00a0styles of trance which now dominate the nightscapes of\u00a0festivals and which now even have exclusive festivals. Sometimes rather\u00a0brutal\u00a0in aesthetic, these styles are rooted in gothic sensibilities some of which\u00a0steer a great distance from the progressive and\u00a0holistic pretentions of\u00a0Goatrance. \r\n \r\nPsychedelic trance is first and foremost localised \u2013 around\u00a0the world scenes have developed and thrived in local regions. There is\u00a0no\u00a0question of it becoming regional \u2013 it already is. The recent re-emergence of\u00a0the scene publication\u00a0Trancers Guide to the\u00a0Galaxy<\/em>\u00a0reflects this, as the publication features scene reports from a\u00a0couple dozen countries where psychedelic trance thrives, 20 years\u00a0after its\u00a0initial development. This is despite the global financial crisis in recent\u00a0years. \r\n<\/p>\r\n  \r\nA focused study of psychedelic traveller-tourism might offer some\u00a0insights on this, but perhaps it is the case that times of crisis are followed\u00a0by a common desire to be\u00a0together, which in the case of psytrance as well as\u00a0other EDM scenes, is an ecstatic desire to\u00a0be\u00a0altered together, using a variety of\u00a0shared sensory technologies. This is\u00a0close to the argument made by Peter Shapiro in\u00a0Turn the Beat Around: The Secret History of\u00a0Disco<\/em>. EDM movements\u00a0have arisen in history and have exploded across the world, maintaining form or\u00a0mutating, in response to\u00a0present conditions of crisis. These dance movements\u00a0take a variety of forms, from the more legitimised with a corporatized style of\u00a0communitas to the more experimental and alternative. The greatest obstacle to\u00a0these developments remains state intervention,\u00a0onerous permit requirements,\u00a0police interventions, and ultimately I would argue, normalisation.\u00a0Event-cultures of this kind seek a\u00a0delicate balance between retaining\u00a0exclusivity and opening the doors.  \r\n \r\nCan you imagine that next movement will focus more on\u00a0the economics of the festivals and have a more egalitarian approach\u00a0in terms of\u00a0the redistribution of income? Can you tell us more about the controversies that\u00a0happen now and then between\u00a0mainstream organisers that ask entry fees for\u00a0festival and the more autonomous free events? The last one sounds more\u00a0idealistic\u00a0but in fact works contrary if you want to set up a more sustainable\u00a0economy. Can you\u00a0imagine that you will paid, one day, to be the movement's\u00a0organic intellectual? I see an urgency here.<\/strong> \r\n \r\nWell, I don\u2019t know about organic intellectual, but I\u00a0have been speaking at events for the last few years. There are a growing\u00a0number\u00a0of festivals that feature cultural programs with workshop and lecture programs\u00a0which have become rather professional\u00a0downstream from developments at the Boom\u00a0Festival in particular which features an excellent and formative area called\u00a0the\u00a0Liminal Village which has daily programs for a week including lectures and\u00a0films on a host of themes of importance to the\u00a0population of an event that now\u00a0averages about 25K. This is clearly more than just a dance music event and\u00a0psytrance is clearly\u00a0more than just about music. And Boom also hosts music\u00a0styles outside of psytrance. This is why I prefer to use the term\u00a0psyculture. \r\n \r\nThe 2013 Ozora Festival in Hungary is another example of a\u00a0major festival, identifying as a \u201cpsychedelic tribal gathering\u201d, which\u00a0features\u00a0a cultural program (in which I participated) and is striving to be more than a\u00a0dance festival. For instance, like Boom, and\u00a0Burning Man, it features a daily\u00a0newspaper. For the record, since you mentioned it, while some of these events\u00a0might pay, it\u2019s\u00a0rarely even enough to cover my own transport expenses. \r\n \r\nThere is a great deal of debate internal to this movement\u00a0over a range of developments, including the price of event tickets. But\u00a0there\u00a0is no simplified way to look at it, because there are many angles. A great many\u00a0people earn their livelihood trading their\u00a0services, arts, labours at these\u00a0events, offering their services and technical support to event management, as\u00a0well as trade goods\u00a0and services at festivals, some travelling in circuits all\u00a0year round. Others will volunteer their labour at events in exchange for\u00a0entry\u00a0and perhaps earn meal tickets. Others are given the opportunity to experiment\u00a0with new techniques or methods, for\u00a0instance, within healing arts or waste\u00a0management (e.g. bio-toilets and showers). Commercial festivals are diverse and\u00a0large scale\u00a0industries upon which many travellers and those living largely \u201coff\u00a0the grid\u201d are able to survive. Within the psychedelic\u00a0movement, the nature of\u00a0this commercialism is subject to constant scrutiny. For instance, corporate\u00a0sponsorship of events is\u00a0generally roundly criticised. \r\n \r\nThere is the critique of the 'mob-driven, hedonistic\u00a0numbness' of certain participants during big festivals. The massive\u00a0mainstream\u00a0character of the festivals is certainly something that is the case here in the\u00a0 Netherlands. Is the trend towards smaller,\u00a0more secretive happenings\u00a0inevitable? And do you find the critique of big festivals as spiritual\u00a0spectacles justified? Has\u00a0commercialism around 2007-2008 killed Psytrance?<\/strong> \r\n \r\nCommercialism has not killed psytrance, nor psyculture.\u00a0Scenes rely on commercialism to sustain a variety of industries upon\u00a0which a\u00a0vast network of people and communities rely for their survival. Most of all,\u00a0the musicians \u2013 i.e. the people who produce the\u00a0music upon which this industry\u00a0relies \u2013 need to make a return for their efforts which in a world of\u00a0file-sharing means live\u00a0appearances at ticketed events. \r\n<\/p>\r\n  \r\nThe reality is complex,\u00a0and always more complicated than any one person can know. I do not claim\u00a0to\u00a0hold a commanding view over the heights of psyculture. It is a massive and\u00a0constantly shifting movement, with elements leading\u00a0in different directions and\u00a0new scenes and regional scenes emerging and changing all the time. I have\u00a0attempted to document\u00a0something of this diversity in the book. Single events\u00a0are characteristic of this diversity. There are also many free or by donation\u00a0parties that happen in most cosmopolitan centres and their hinterlands like\u00a0around Melbourne. Large festivals that charge for\u00a0entrance, like Boom, offer\u00a0freedoms to experiment, express and explore alternatives in ways that small\u00a0events that may be free of\u00a0charge do not. Are such events not also free\u00a0cultural spaces, since they are cultural spaces that promote freedoms? \r\n \r\nAll that said I recently saw how psytrance is getting\u00a0showcased at multi-genre events like the Boomtown Fair in the UK, where\u00a0those\u00a0who can afford the 170 quid ticket become exposed to a condensed simulacra of\u00a0the scene. In this contrivance, mega and\u00a0crossover events, like Boomtown,\u00a0appear to host EDM spaces as relatively self-contained stylistic worlds.\u00a0Perhaps the promo for\u00a0such an event could be "HavewegotPsytrancefor\u00a0you!" I'm playing with the phrase "Havewegotavacationfor\u00a0you!", the slogan\u00a0from Delos, the promoters of themed worlds for high-end\u00a0customers, including Westworld<\/em>, in Michael Crichton's Sci Fi novel by\u00a0that\u00a0name, adapted for the 1973 MGM film...\u00a0\u00a0But\u00a0then it might be really cool to oscillate between Psyworld and Dubworld. \r\n \r\nOver the years, many have tried to politicise the\u00a0movement. In retrospect, can we say that this is failed project because the\u00a0participants were more interested in their private transitional experience? In\u00a0many cultures spiritual border experiences through\u00a0music, dance and drugs is\u00a0controversial enough. Wouldn't it make more sense to emphasize the underground\u00a0aspect of Psytrance?\u00a0To politicise the movement, to make it more public, and\u00a0democratize its intentions, always runs the risk of instrumentalization\u2014and\u00a0eventually disappointment.<\/strong> \r\n \r\nYou may hold to a narrow version of \u201cpolitics\u201d that I\u00a0don\u2019t share. In my previous book\u00a0Technomad:\u00a0Global Raving\u00a0Countercultures<\/em>, I\u00a0tried to outline a theory of resistance that grew out of studies of EDM\u00a0cultures which I called \u201chyper-responsibility.\u201d That is, I saw that\u00a0techno-tribes across EDM genres mount vibes (socio-sonic aesthetics) that are\u00a0characterised by\u00a0a spectrum of responses to the conditions of the present among\u00a0its practitioners. Events are vehicles for differential freedoms\u00a0from a range\u00a0of conditions experienced by participants. They may be opportunities for\u00a0transgression, or personal liberations, and\u00a0they may be platforms for\u00a0reactionary or progressive movements whose goals lie beyond the dancefloor.\u00a0Psychedelic trance\u00a0possesses this hyper-responsiveness. In some cases, the\u00a0simple act of holding a party within repressive social and political\u00a0climates\u00a0is a definite political accomplishment. Expressing one\u2019s commitment towards\u00a0cognitive freedom in a global climate of\u00a0repressive drug legislation are\u00a0actions that should be recognised as political. In other cases holding events\u00a0in times of social\u00a0transformation \u2013 early Goa parties in Germany for example -\u00a0furnishes events with a revolutionary sensibility. \r\n \r\nIn Global Tribe you have not focused on an analysis of\u00a0the music. Can you do that for us and describe, in detail, one of your\u00a0favourite tracks of psytrance? What's the sound, the vibe, of psytrance? What\u00a0do you hear that we do not experience?<\/strong> \r\n \r\nYes, the music does not receive analysis in the fashion\u00a0that would be treated, for instance, by a musicologist or a music\u00a0historian.\u00a0But then again, musicologists have a habit of squeezing the life from cultural\u00a0experience in overly technical analyses.\u00a0What you\u2019re getting is what is stated\u00a0on the tin \u2013 i.e., the book is not music history or music criticism. \r\n \r\nI provide here, however, a basic description of the Goa\u00a0Trance sound from which psychedelic trance and its various subgenre\u00a0developments\u00a0are indebted. This description was put together with the help of Toni\u00a0Aittoniemi who recently completed an MA on\u00a0the \u201cCultural and Musical\u00a0Dimensions of Goa Trance and Early Psychedelic Trance in Finland\u201d:\u00a0https:\/\/helda.helsinki.fi\/handle\/10138\/34536<\/a>.\u00a0(This description could be expanded and music criticism applied to this and\u00a0subsequent developments). \r\n \r\nAlthough the sound, which emerged\u00a0by 1994 as a marketable genre, received great variation according to stylistic\u00a0 influences,\u00a0fusional developments, and regional aesthetics, there emerged a\u00a0\u2018classic\u2019 Goa Trance style led by a strong four quarter-note kick\u00a0drum pattern\u00a0in 4\/4, with a more or less constant accentuation of the 16th-note layer at\u00a0bpm\u2019s between 130\u2013150. \r\n<\/p>\r\n  \r\nProminent\u00a0early artists experimented with analogue sound\u00a0sources, digital and hybrid synthesizers, samplers and digital drum machines to\u00a0build evolving patterns with layered synth sounds and sub-bass frequencies in\u00a0hypnotic arrangements. Artists used MIDI\u00a0(Multiple Instrument Digital\u00a0Interface), computers, and software. Among the most familiar sounds were the\u00a0fast arpeggio-patterns\u00a0and strong sawtooth-wave leads running through a\u00a0resonant band-pass or high-pass filter, such as found in the work of Astral\u00a0Projection and Etnica. Early works employed additive rhythmic characteristics\u00a0in the bassline, like the Latin-American\u00a0tresillo\u00a0(the\u00a0duple-pulse rhythmic cell)\u00a0or variations of \u201coriental\u00a0patterns.\u201d While syncopation receded in later developments, intricate\u00a0triple-meter accenting embedded in a \u201cstraight\u201d duple-framework persisted in\u00a0the higher frequency layers, arpeggios, percussive\u00a0elements and leads. These\u00a0embedded alternative signatures combined with the frequent use of the Phrygian\u00a0Major scale to give\u00a0Goa Trance an \u201cEastern\u201d feel. The tracks were programmed\u00a0into 8-10 minute long pieces. \r\n \r\nIs some of this music online?\u00a0Can you give some pointers? Compilations are important, I understood. The album\u00a0was never the\u00a0right format for this type of music. Can you mention a few more\u00a0\u2018classic\u2019 tracks that you like? We\u2019re now 20-30 years later. How\u00a0would you\u00a0describe the style and the \u2018feel\u2019 of the music?<\/strong> \r\n \r\nNetlabels\u00a0have grown popular here as in other EDM developments. One chief portal (and\u00a0label) is Ektoplazm<\/a>\u00a0 (www.ektoplazm.com) founded by Alexander Synaptic (Basilisk). That site\u00a0incidentally features a spectrum of psychedelic\u00a0electronic music, where the\u00a0term \u201cpsytrance\u201d holds much less explanatory power than it once did. A \u201cone\u00a0stop shop\u201d (it's a free\u00a0download) can land you the epic\u00a0Ektoplazm's Greatest\u00a0Trips<\/a>, 50 tracks from 2008-2012 compiled by Basilisk showcasing \u201cthe\u00a0immense diversity and creative vitality of the global psychedelic trance, techno,\u00a0and downtempo movements.\u201d\r\n<\/p>\r\n  \r\nAlbums and\u00a0EPs (in digital files) continue to be a chief means by which artists will make\u00a0a name for themselves, alongside\u00a0Soundcloud, and there is prestige to being\u00a0selected on label compilations, and ultimately selected by touring DJs.\u00a0Expressing\u00a0artistic vision in concept albums appears retained in this\u00a0development, inheriting much from psychedelic forebears, although the\u00a0\u201cvision\u201d\u00a0is somewhat distributed as artists can take on a variety of personas and be\u00a0involved with numerous acts, in response to\u00a0changing styles and tastes. In many\u00a0cases, the overall vision seems to be retained, as with the prodigious output\u00a0of Jake\u00a0Stephenson (aka Shamanic Tribes on Acid \u2013 i.e. STONA) who was involved\u00a0in, from the last count at Discogs, some 58 named\u00a0production projects. The\u00a0industry characteristics of this development deserve greater attention, including\u00a0how many DJ\/producer\u00a0names in the psychedelic tradition are more than just\u00a0names, but invented personas. \r\n \r\n\u201cClassic\u201d\u00a0covers quite some territory for me and I could go on for pages, but from a\u00a0mid-1990s era perspective I'll be mercifully\u00a0brief - besides Hallucinogen\u00a0(Simon Posford) who was responsible for shaping the sound of psychedelic trance\u00a0with many classic\u00a0tracks like anything from\u00a0The Lone Deranger<\/em>, as well\u00a0as tracks like \u201cSpace Pussy\u201d and \u201cLSD\u201d (Posford is also the chief engineer\u00a0behind chief act in the psychedelic diaspora Sphongle (with Raja Ram), I like\u00a0early X-Dream, Earth Nation, Total Eclipse, Astral\u00a0Projection, Etnica, Eat\u00a0Static, System 7, Third Eye, Human Blue, Synchro (on the psybreaks edge), and\u00a0UX, especially \u201cMaster of the\u00a0Universe\u201d which was dark and brooding and\u00a0thunderous psychedelic opera, and ahead of its time (their album\u00a0Ultimate\u00a0Experience<\/em>\u00a0(1997) was recently remastered to superb effect). \r\n<\/p>\r\n  \r\nUltimately I\u00a0cannot nail it down to any one sound. But as far as the\u00a0music is concerned,\u00a0it's all about the context \u2013 i.e. the dancefloor and the event itself. You\u00a0cannot understand this music, nor\u00a0indeed most EDM sounds, through your\u00a0headphones at home or in the car. It's truly experienced as shared vibrating\u00a0rhythms in\u00a0fully optimised social dance contexts. In my experience, the most\u00a0optimised environment for this experience is the Dance Temple\u00a0(i.e the main\u00a0dancefloor) at the Boom Festival. \r\n \r\nWhat do you make of Simon Reynolds' retromania thesis?\u00a0Psytrance is not precisely retro. If anything it could be labelled as\u00a0\u20181990s\u00a0music\u2019. Still, all the retrogarde aspect of the contemporary recording industry\u00a0affect psytrance as well.<\/strong> \r\n \r\nI haven't read\u00a0Retromania<\/em>. I agree that there\u00a0remains a core Goa sensibility motoring this development across generations, a\u00a0whole gestalt and marketable format that was crafted in the 1990s to simulate\u00a0the seasonal DJ-led full moon beach party\u00a0interzone of the 1980s, which itself\u00a0built upon the cosmic throw downs of the 1970s \u2013 and which were originally and over\u00a025\u00a0seasons subject to the influx of styles and techniques from scenes all over\u00a0the world. \r\n<\/p>\r\n  \r\nThe bandwidth of this stylistic profusion may\u00a0have been narrowed at\u00a0the advent of a music marketed as Goa Trance (e.g. care of Dragonfly Records)\u00a0but today's events,\u00a0especially the larger festivals downstream from this\u00a0heritage are diverse, partly because they continue to be influenced by new\u00a0trends, including as mentioned, the dark sensibility, but also dubstep, and\u00a0progressive developments. And yet, when I entered the\u00a0chill space on the\u00a0Thursday night at the 2013 edition of the Ozora festival in Hungary, I might\u00a0have been transported back to\u00a0Anjuna beach in 1974 at the height of the full\u00a0moon. This is among the most impressive chill spaces anywhere, and Solar Fields\u00a0was coming on - good timing as I joined the buzz inside a giant beehive. Over\u00a0the next two hours a convulsive crowd orgasm\u00a0achieved peak after peak. Ambient\u00a0electronica has remained integral to psyculture and has been a chief aesthetic\u00a0in the\u00a0psychedelic continuum, since the early Goa period and highly optimised\u00a0chill spaces carry the event-cultural heritage as much as\u00a0main floors. \r\n \r\nIs it possible to compare or to contrast the Psytrance\u00a0with the Global Justice Movement (Seattle, Genova) and the recent\u00a0occupations\u00a0such as in Tel Aviv, Tahir, Occupy Wall Street and Taksim, also known as the\u00a0Movements of the Squares? The aspect of\u00a0gathering seems very important, you\u00a0stress this time and again.<\/strong> \r\n \r\nVery different kinds of events, and my return question\u00a0to you would be: is a favourable comparison required for psyculture\u00a0events to\u00a0be considered worthy of attention? Based on narrow perceptions of political\u00a0behaviour, possibly not. But then I do not\u00a0hold to a narrow perception of the\u00a0\u201cpolitical.\u201d It could be argued that psyculture and visionary arts events\u00a0represent the pinnacle\u00a0achievement of freedom at the other end of the\u00a0revolution, enabled by liberal democracies with a healthy middle class and high\u00a0standards of living. Over time, the experience filters through to those\u00a0populations who do not match the privileged status of their\u00a0forebears. \r\n \r\nCan psyculture events be the means of revolution? Possibly\u00a0not in terms of being confrontational or \u2018protestival\u2019 events, but this\u00a0has not\u00a0stopped events like Boom from adopting radical social and cultural agendas. In\u00a0fact, like Burning Man, Boom and other\u00a0events have developed as platforms for\u00a0change by hosting spaces in which a range of ecological, alter-globalization\u00a0and wellbeing\u00a0causes are showcased, modelled by and transmitted to its\u00a0participating populations and regional communities. \r\n<\/p>\r\n  \r\nThe way an event is\u00a0organised, or indeed self-organised as in the case of Burning Man, which holds\u00a0to a set of principles that highlight participation,\u00a0gifting, self\u2013reliance\u00a0etc., is itself the revolution in action. But I want to come back to something\u00a0that is overlooked constantly in\u00a0these kinds of comparisons and by people who\u00a0insist on measuring the value of psycultural and visionary arts events against\u00a0the\u00a0Occupy movement and more recent revolutionary protest movements. Being\u00a0altered together in\u00a0dance, either\u00a0with your\u00a0neighbours in small gatherings close to home, or in an experience\u00a0shared with thousands from a hundred different countries (as\u00a0is the case at\u00a0Boom\u2019s Dance Temple) is significant on its own and does not need to be measured\u00a0against other forms of gathering. \r\n \r\nWhat are you working on right now? Is my desire for a\u00a0comprehensive history of Goa-trance (as you have described in\u00a0chapter one)\u00a0justified? I seem to recall that you have not been to Goa yourself.<\/strong> \r\n \r\nNo, I haven't been to Goa.\u00a0Global Tribe<\/em>\u00a0is a post Goa\u00a0project, addressing the emergence and culture of festivals that arose in the\u00a0slipstream of Goa. I would also point out that, as far as I am aware,\u00a0researchers of Goa music scenes haven't been to Goa either, at\u00a0least not Goa\u00a0pre-1993 which is the year that key participants argue marked the end of the\u00a0momentous seasonal and\u00a0experimental trance dance era before the whole thing\u00a0imploded and exploded (i.e. was transposed internationally in the form of\u00a0music\u00a0aesthetics and event-cultures). A comprehensive history of Goatrance is not\u00a0unjustified \u2013 I'm waiting to see it myself;\u00a0possibly produced by someone\u00a0involved in that music scene through its development. In addition to that, it\u00a0would be great to read\u00a0a history of Goa seasonal party culture, pre Goatrance\u00a0(i.e 1960s-1980s). A history of the DAT and how the beach found its own\u00a0uses\u00a0for technology would also be fascinating. \r\n \r\nOne of the projects I'm involved in at present is a study of\u00a0the Burning Man diaspora in Europe and elsewhere, a project which\u00a0retains my\u00a0interest in global event-cultural movements. With a global network of burners\u00a0forming their own events in regions\u00a0worldwide, the world's largest temporary\u00a0city, Black Rock City, now has considerable reach and appeal worldwide, with\u00a0regional\u00a0events all over the world. It\u2019s a phenomenon warranting attention.\r\n<\/p>\r\n  \r\n \r\n<\/p>\r\n  \r\nThis interview originally appeared on the\u00a0Nettime<\/a>\u00a0mailing list.<\/em>\r\n<\/p>\r\n  \r\n\u00a0Image by<\/em> laurens28<\/a>, courtesy of Creative Commons license.\u00a0<\/em>\r\n<\/p>\r\n  \r\n \r\n<\/p>\r\n",

Offering a torrent of mind-expanding ideas and information, THE LOTTERY OF BIRTH is going to make you think again about what it means to be free. \r\n \r\nIn this live video discussion<\/a>, writer\/co-director Raoul Martinez will explore the provocative issues raised by the film, his experience making it, and his vision of the complete trilogy of films of which LOTTERY is the first part. This 60 minute webinar will start with a presentation by Raoul, followed by a lively Q&A. You will be part of the conversation, asking your questions on camera, like on a Skype call.\u00a0 \r\n \r\nDrawing on the best minds in philosophy, history, psychology, physics and economics -- including a stellar cast of interviewees from Noam Chomsky, Howard Zinn and Vandana Shiva to Steven Pinker, Daniel Dennett and Tony Benn -- the film employs decades of evidence to interrogate what we are, where we are and where we want to be.  \r\n \r\nFrom birth onwards our minds are a battleground of competing forces. The outcome of this battle determines the society we create. This is a film about the cultural, educational, political and commercial forces that shape our identities, often in ways that limit both our personal and political freedom. Whether you are into philosophy, economics or simply being a better person than you were born to be, you can\u2019t afford to miss this film. \r\n \r\nBrought to you by Mangu.tv<\/a>\r\nTHE LOTTERY OF BIRTH was nominated for Best Documentary at Raindance Film festival and won the Artivist Spirit award in LA. It was produced by Mangu.tv.  \r\n \r\nParticipants in this webinar receive a ticket to an online viewing of THE LOTTERY OF BIRTH, which you can view at any time from the moment of purchase until the live, online discussion on September 17. \r\n<\/div>\r\n \r\n \r\nClick here for more information.<\/a>\u00a0\u00a0\r\n<\/div>\r\n",

      "post_content": " \r\n \r\nAustralian cultural critic Graham St. John has written a\u00a0groundbreaking study on the way\u00a0the\u00a0electronic dance music (EDM) genre\u00a0called\u00a0Goatrance\u00a0globalized itself as a movement.\u00a0In\u00a0Global\u00a0Tribe: Technology, Spirituality and Psytrance<\/em>\u00a0 (Equinox, 2012), he\u00a0describes Goatrance not merely\u00a0as\u00a0a subcategory of EDM. Psytrance, as\u00a0it is also called,\u00a0is first and foremost a\u00a0culture\u00a0that is\u00a0celebrated\u00a0through events such as parties and festivals. The emphasis here is not on\u00a0regular clubs or labels but on personal\u00a0transformation which is celebrated in a\u00a0collective fashion. \r\n<\/p>\r\n  \r\nMusic\u00a0has a supportive role here, it is\u00a0literally\u00a0a medium, a\u00a0transportative\u00a0vehicle to carry us into another realm of consciousness. As Graham points out in the intro, \u201cEnabling\u00a0departures\u00a0from dominant codes of practice and arrivals at alternative modes of\u00a0being, the dance floor and the community proliferating\u00a0around its verges, are\u00a0built according to the design of a radical utopian imagination.\u201d The traveller-scholar\u00a0St. John has given\u00a0himself the task to articulate, theorize and popularize that\u00a0imagination. Because of the \u2018serving\u2019 task of the music, music criticism\u00a0plays less of a role in this case. \r\n \r\nIf anything, Graham St. John is a Critic of the Cosmic Event.\u00a0I\u2019d love to see him as a contemporary organic intellectual (as Gramsci\u00a0defined\u00a0it) of the psytrance movement. His intimate knowledge of the festivals and\u00a0their \u2018architechtonics of transition\u2019 has put\u00a0Graham St. John at odds with\u00a0traditional (Anglo-Saxon) academia that has a hard time understanding underground cultures which\u00a0position themselves outside of\u00a0the\u00a0pop mainstream.\u00a0\r\n<\/p>\r\n  \r\nAlthough he is passionate about music, Graham St John is not a musicologist.\u00a0He\u00a0is\u00a0a\u00a0chronologist\u00a0of the movement that records and reflects on spiritual cultures. He shies away\u00a0from\u00a0taking\u00a0up the role of the\u00a0ideologist. He is not the type of guy who describes what is\u00a0on the other side of the \u2018doors of perception\u2019 such as Kesey, Leary,\u00a0McKenna\u00a0and others. In 2003 we were colleagues at the Brisbane Centre for Critical and\u00a0Cultural Studies under Graeme Turner.\u00a0In the years after we managed to meet up\u00a0several times and stayed in contact, for instance over the Dancecult journal\u00a0and list that\u00a0 Graham co-founded. The launch of this major chronology of the\u00a0movement seemed the right moment to do an interview. \r\n \r\nAfter an introduction that maps out transnational\u00a0psycultures,\u00a0Global Tribe<\/em> takes us back to the\u00a0unruly 1970s and 1980s when\u00a0hippies the world over embarked for Goa (India) to\u00a0camp out on Anjuna Beach,\u00a0make music\u00a0and dance. It\u00a0 was\u00a0around the mid-80s\u00a0that a distinct\u00a0DJ-led\u00a0dance\u00a0culture\u00a0emerged\u00a0in Goa,\u00a0produced by travelling DJs\u00a0who brought\u00a0 cassettes, DAT tapes and later CDs. \r\n<\/p>\r\n  \r\nIn\u00a0the mid section of the book, Graham looks\u00a0at the darker sides of the psytrance experience, the \u2018spiritual technologies\u2019, and\u00a0describes the technoshamanism in part induced by psychedelic\u00a0drugs. A third part describes the \u2018carnival\u2019 aspect of\u00a0psychedelic\u00a0festivals and related visionary arts. We then dig into case studies\u00a0of festival scenes in Israel and Australia (where the events are\u00a0called\u00a0\u2018doofs\u2019). Throughout the study St. John comes back to his visits to Boom,\u00a0one of Europe\u2019s\u00a0 largest festivals, in Portugal, visited\u00a0by tens of\u00a0thousands, prompting the central question of Global Tribe<\/em>: what is the\u00a0sociality and sensuality of dance? \r\n \r\nGeert Lovink: In the book there are traces of your own\u00a0experience, but not all that many. You struggle to get recognition as an\u00a0academic scholar while at the same time you are also clearly part of this\u00a0spiritual trance movement. Do you also keep a diary? Are\u00a0there things you\u00a0hesitate to write about? Global Tribe<\/em> attempts to be an official history of the\u00a0exodus of the movement, post-Goa,\u00a0becoming a planetary phenomenon.<\/strong> \r\n \r\nGraham St John:\u00a0Global Tribe<\/em> is layered with my own experience in a style that\u00a0I believe is accessible, certainly by comparison to\u00a0most academic books. I\u2019ve\u00a0tried to produce a book that is accessible to those outside academia. This is\u00a0not an easy task, especially\u00a0given that those trained within the social\u00a0sciences do not normally possess advanced literary skills. And also, many of\u00a0those within\u00a0the wider movement population (the \u201cglobal tribe\u201d) are from\u00a0non-English backgrounds. And besides, it is notoriously difficult to\u00a0write\u00a0about the vibe from a \u201cscientific\u201d angle without coming across as a massive\u00a0douche nozzle. \r\n \r\nI\u2019m not as preoccupied with being recognised within academia\u00a0as you seem to infer. Most academics are politicians and\u00a0administrators working\u00a0in environments rewarding the greatest competitors and charlatans. I\u2019ve sought\u00a0to avoid this. Most of my\u00a0current work is in fact part of an effort to move\u00a0beyond the confines and limitations of academia. At this stage, I may not\u00a0publish\u00a0another academic book, as continuing exploitation by the academic\u00a0publishing industry is not a relationship I\u2019ve grown fond of. \r\n \r\nMy writing method is like the zone report technique. Given\u00a0that the experience of events is relatively temporary and not\u00a0uncommonly\u00a0intense, when I emerge from an event (party, festival, gathering\u2026) it has\u00a0usually been the case that I immerse myself\u00a0in writing. This has most often\u00a0been in the form of blogging, so my \u201cdiary\u201d as such becomes rather public and\u00a0also a great way of\u00a0soliciting feedback and ensuring accuracy. These blog\u00a0reports have often been the basis for later articles and book chapters. I\u00a0haven\u2019t done much lately, but a keep a blog at Blogspot<\/a>. \r\n \r\nAt\u00a0Dancecult: Journal of Electronic Dance Music Culture<\/em><\/a> (http:\/\/dj.dancecult.net)\u00a0we encourage\u00a0authors to write \u201czone\u201d style reports\u00a0with experimental stylistic and\u00a0experiential angles submitted to our From the Floor section. \r\n \r\nThere are things I hesitate to write about. This cultural\u00a0movement is permeated with ambiguity with relation to the law. Electronic\u00a0dance\u00a0music cultures are by their very nature outside or between the law, which can\u00a0be observed from a variety of angles \u2013 e.g.\u00a0unpermitted events, the use of\u00a0prohibited substances or the unlicensed mixing of controlled media content, an\u00a0experimentalism in\u00a0consumption and production practices that challenge laws,\u00a0regulations and codes. \r\n<\/p>\r\n  \r\nAny researcher needs to be careful in order to\u00a0protect\u00a0not only themselves but also their interlocutors and the events they write\u00a0about. That said, self-censoring everything one\u00a0does and says is anathema to\u00a0cutting edge research and writing. Finding artful techniques of representation\u00a0is a challenge, which\u00a0can be rewarding. In my own experience, blog reports and\u00a0subsequent articles and chapters are among efforts to push the\u00a0boundaries of\u00a0writing as method. See my recent article in\u00a0Dancecult\u00a0on \u201cwriting the\u00a0vibe<\/a>\u201d for instance, which remixed what I call\u00a0nanomedia\u00a0\u2013 fragments of\u00a0popular culture and media sources re-mediated and programmed by EDM producers\u00a0in music - as one\u00a0way to represent the vibe, i.e. perform the impossible (\u2028https:\/\/www104.griffith.edu.au\/index.php\/dancecult\/article\/view\/357\/362). \r\n \r\nDo you do prefer live pieces or can't we speak of a\u00a0distinction between live and pre-recorded? Do you believe in the perfect\u00a0sample?\u00a0\u00a0In your book you describe the\u00a0importance of live music that started off with the hours-long sessions of bands\u00a0like the\u00a0Grateful Dead. The schism you describe around the late seventies,\u00a0between the analogue, acoustic live jamming session on the Goa\u00a0beach and the\u00a0update of consumer electronics such as cassettes and DAT recording I find very\u00a0interesting in this respect.<\/strong> \r\n \r\nLiveness is a thoroughly contentious issue in EDM\u00a0performance and its study. I broached this in the book, but it\u2019s covered\u00a0more\u00a0comprehensively elsewhere. There will be those who argue for the genuine or\u00a0authentic nature of \u201clive\u201d performance, by\u00a0which is often meant bands or fusion\u00a0bands, using traditional instruments, e.g. a drum kit, but as has long been\u00a0recognised,\u00a0technics, from mixing desks to DJ performance software manipulated\u00a0on screen, from turntables to DAT, are instruments \u201cplayed\u201d\u00a0by musicians (i.e.\u00a0DJ\/producers). \r\n<\/p>\r\n  \r\nOf course, artists will establish varying degrees of competence\u00a0and skilfulness in techniques of\u00a0production and performance, but it has long\u00a0been recognised that production and performance are inseparable in EDM.\u00a0Ultimately DJ\/producers are playing an organic instrument that is\u00a0you\u00a0\u2013 i.e. your body on the dance floor,\u00a0and dancers are\u00a0 responding to an assemblage of factors, associated with a range\u00a0of sensory technologies optimised for a live experience. But DJs\u00a0aren\u2019t working\u00a0alone, which is one of the reasons why the question of liveness is often\u00a0wrongfooted. DJs collaborate with a\u00a0network of engineers and technicians,\u00a0visual artists, stage designers in any standard dance party or festival\u00a0environment, and how\u00a0well they do this is subject to ongoing internal debate\u00a0and discussion within scenes which seek to optimise and re-optimise these\u00a0relationships integral to EDM event-cultures. \r\n \r\nCan you also imagine a psytrance that would have gone in\u00a0a completely different direction, not electronic (techno) but for\u00a0instance more\u00a0influenced by world music? Can we say that the electronic element is essential\u00a0or is it rather accidental, a vehicle\u00a0for trance? In your book you emphasize\u00a0the centrality of dance. Dance comes\u00a0first, it brings you in the desired mood, the trance\u00a0(induced by drugs). The\u00a0music style comes second. What counts is the rhythm.<\/strong> \r\n \r\nFor some of those involved in the early full moon party\u00a0scene in Goa, which was a cosmic rock scene, they anticipated a\u00a0movement that\u00a0for them was thoroughly ruined by electronic music by the early 1980s. One of\u00a0the founders of the trance dance\u00a0music scene in Anjuna, Steve Devas, who\u00a0brought the first sound system to Anjuna in 1974, was enthusiastic at that time\u00a0about\u00a0what he called the \u201cCosmo Rock\u201d style which, as he stated to me and is\u00a0reproduced in the book, was \u201ca\u00a0potentially dynamic and\u00a0inspiring style of music to follow seventies UK and\u00a0California rock into an Indo-Hybrid new wave of rock music, that was to be\u00a0high,\u00a0lyrical and drivey with ethno world funk baselines to make for subtle and\u00a0sophisticated dance movements. In other words, music\u00a0for beach, sun and palm\u00a0trees and not cars, factories and mechanical big city urban landscapes\u201d. \r\n \r\nAs we know, by the mid 1980s, the performance of electronic\u00a0music (by DJs) had come to dominate these same full moon events\u00a0and their\u00a0subsequent developments. Electrosonic technics became integral to psychedelic\u00a0trance as it was to all other EDM\u00a0developments, from house to techno. What\u00a0became Goatrance and psychedelic trance, which is as much a culture as it is\u00a0music, is\u00a0a phenomenon that was enabled by developments in electronic music\u00a0production and performance. \r\n<\/p>\r\n  \r\nAs key producers, label heads\u00a0and event management\u00a0in this movement will tell you, sound frequencies and scales were being\u00a0produced by synthesisers that\u00a0were not available with traditional instruments.\u00a0Besides this, it has been much easier and cheaper to organise and reproduce\u00a0events in remote regions like Goa or in many of the out of the way places in\u00a0which festivals and parties are held using DJs in the\u00a0place of bands. In Goa,\u00a0one DJ like DJ Laurent using a DAT player could be responsible for an 8-10 hour\u00a0set that was mind\u00a0blowing, as opposed to a series of bands with a lot of\u00a0equipment requiring more effort, money, energy and resources. \r\n<\/p>\r\n  \r\nToday\u2019s\u00a0festivals\u00a0are downstream from this efficiency and resourcefulness, although they have\u00a0become increasingly optimised with very\u00a0high production values, and diversified.\u00a0For instance, Portugal\u2019s Boom Festival features a fusion band stage\/dance\u00a0floor, in\u00a0conjunction with several other dancefloors, returning us in a way to\u00a0the earlier fusional environment of Goa, which is certainly a\u00a0success for Boom,\u00a0since it emerged as an effort to reproduce the Goa seasonal party experience\u00a0outside of Goa. \r\n \r\nCulturally you position the post-Goa Trance movement\u00a0across the globe as part of the 1990s post-Cold War movements\u00a0defined by their\u00a0cyberoptimism, spiritual renaissance and the collective rituals of transition\u00a0and consciousness experiences. Do\u00a0you think that this New Age style of events\u00a0has come to an end after the global financial crisis and the growth of (youth)\u00a0unemployment? After all, visiting a global festival does cost money, in\u00a0particular the travelling. You could estimate that the post-Goa-movement would\u00a0become more regional or even local.<\/strong> \r\n \r\nToday\u2019s events are diverse, which is a theme implicit to\u00a0the book, as it\u2019s a diversity that was there from the inception, and\u00a0which\u00a0remains, despite industry and aesthetic formulas. I wouldn't characterise\u00a0psychedelic trance or its event culture as New\u00a0Age, certainly not by any\u00a0standard measurements of \u201cNew Age.\u201d\u00a0 For\u00a0one thing, that term has grown empty of meaning in the\u00a0present, especially in\u00a0relation to events in which transpersonal experiences may be occasioned within\u00a0social contexts, i.e. that are\u00a0participatory and relational. Studies which\u00a0perceive spirituality as private and internalised don't tend to account for\u00a0this. \r\n<\/p>\r\n  \r\nWhat's\u00a0more, in studies of New Age phenomena there is little accounting\u00a0for the alteration of consciousness using psychoactivating or\u00a0psychointegrating\u00a0compounds from MDMA to LSD or DMT, etc. This is largely because the academic\u00a0study of what became\u00a0identified as New Age was overseen by public funded\u00a0intellectuals who avoided anything to do with illicit substances given the\u00a0moratorium on research associated with prohibition. But it\u2019s also simply the\u00a0case that most participants in this movement won\u2019t\u00a0identify as New Agers. As\u00a0mentioned, it\u2019s a complex development. Since the early 2000s we\u2019ve seen the\u00a0development of \u201cdark\u201d\u00a0styles of trance which now dominate the nightscapes of\u00a0festivals and which now even have exclusive festivals. Sometimes rather\u00a0brutal\u00a0in aesthetic, these styles are rooted in gothic sensibilities some of which\u00a0steer a great distance from the progressive and\u00a0holistic pretentions of\u00a0Goatrance. \r\n \r\nPsychedelic trance is first and foremost localised \u2013 around\u00a0the world scenes have developed and thrived in local regions. There is\u00a0no\u00a0question of it becoming regional \u2013 it already is. The recent re-emergence of\u00a0the scene publication\u00a0Trancers Guide to the\u00a0Galaxy<\/em>\u00a0reflects this, as the publication features scene reports from a\u00a0couple dozen countries where psychedelic trance thrives, 20 years\u00a0after its\u00a0initial development. This is despite the global financial crisis in recent\u00a0years. \r\n<\/p>\r\n  \r\nA focused study of psychedelic traveller-tourism might offer some\u00a0insights on this, but perhaps it is the case that times of crisis are followed\u00a0by a common desire to be\u00a0together, which in the case of psytrance as well as\u00a0other EDM scenes, is an ecstatic desire to\u00a0be\u00a0altered together, using a variety of\u00a0shared sensory technologies. This is\u00a0close to the argument made by Peter Shapiro in\u00a0Turn the Beat Around: The Secret History of\u00a0Disco<\/em>. EDM movements\u00a0have arisen in history and have exploded across the world, maintaining form or\u00a0mutating, in response to\u00a0present conditions of crisis. These dance movements\u00a0take a variety of forms, from the more legitimised with a corporatized style of\u00a0communitas to the more experimental and alternative. The greatest obstacle to\u00a0these developments remains state intervention,\u00a0onerous permit requirements,\u00a0police interventions, and ultimately I would argue, normalisation.\u00a0Event-cultures of this kind seek a\u00a0delicate balance between retaining\u00a0exclusivity and opening the doors.  \r\n \r\nCan you imagine that next movement will focus more on\u00a0the economics of the festivals and have a more egalitarian approach\u00a0in terms of\u00a0the redistribution of income? Can you tell us more about the controversies that\u00a0happen now and then between\u00a0mainstream organisers that ask entry fees for\u00a0festival and the more autonomous free events? The last one sounds more\u00a0idealistic\u00a0but in fact works contrary if you want to set up a more sustainable\u00a0economy. Can you\u00a0imagine that you will paid, one day, to be the movement's\u00a0organic intellectual? I see an urgency here.<\/strong> \r\n \r\nWell, I don\u2019t know about organic intellectual, but I\u00a0have been speaking at events for the last few years. There are a growing\u00a0number\u00a0of festivals that feature cultural programs with workshop and lecture programs\u00a0which have become rather professional\u00a0downstream from developments at the Boom\u00a0Festival in particular which features an excellent and formative area called\u00a0the\u00a0Liminal Village which has daily programs for a week including lectures and\u00a0films on a host of themes of importance to the\u00a0population of an event that now\u00a0averages about 25K. This is clearly more than just a dance music event and\u00a0psytrance is clearly\u00a0more than just about music. And Boom also hosts music\u00a0styles outside of psytrance. This is why I prefer to use the term\u00a0psyculture. \r\n \r\nThe 2013 Ozora Festival in Hungary is another example of a\u00a0major festival, identifying as a \u201cpsychedelic tribal gathering\u201d, which\u00a0features\u00a0a cultural program (in which I participated) and is striving to be more than a\u00a0dance festival. For instance, like Boom, and\u00a0Burning Man, it features a daily\u00a0newspaper. For the record, since you mentioned it, while some of these events\u00a0might pay, it\u2019s\u00a0rarely even enough to cover my own transport expenses. \r\n \r\nThere is a great deal of debate internal to this movement\u00a0over a range of developments, including the price of event tickets. But\u00a0there\u00a0is no simplified way to look at it, because there are many angles. A great many\u00a0people earn their livelihood trading their\u00a0services, arts, labours at these\u00a0events, offering their services and technical support to event management, as\u00a0well as trade goods\u00a0and services at festivals, some travelling in circuits all\u00a0year round. Others will volunteer their labour at events in exchange for\u00a0entry\u00a0and perhaps earn meal tickets. Others are given the opportunity to experiment\u00a0with new techniques or methods, for\u00a0instance, within healing arts or waste\u00a0management (e.g. bio-toilets and showers). Commercial festivals are diverse and\u00a0large scale\u00a0industries upon which many travellers and those living largely \u201coff\u00a0the grid\u201d are able to survive. Within the psychedelic\u00a0movement, the nature of\u00a0this commercialism is subject to constant scrutiny. For instance, corporate\u00a0sponsorship of events is\u00a0generally roundly criticised. \r\n \r\nThere is the critique of the 'mob-driven, hedonistic\u00a0numbness' of certain participants during big festivals. The massive\u00a0mainstream\u00a0character of the festivals is certainly something that is the case here in the\u00a0 Netherlands. Is the trend towards smaller,\u00a0more secretive happenings\u00a0inevitable? And do you find the critique of big festivals as spiritual\u00a0spectacles justified? Has\u00a0commercialism around 2007-2008 killed Psytrance?<\/strong> \r\n \r\nCommercialism has not killed psytrance, nor psyculture.\u00a0Scenes rely on commercialism to sustain a variety of industries upon\u00a0which a\u00a0vast network of people and communities rely for their survival. Most of all,\u00a0the musicians \u2013 i.e. the people who produce the\u00a0music upon which this industry\u00a0relies \u2013 need to make a return for their efforts which in a world of\u00a0file-sharing means live\u00a0appearances at ticketed events. \r\n<\/p>\r\n  \r\nThe reality is complex,\u00a0and always more complicated than any one person can know. I do not claim\u00a0to\u00a0hold a commanding view over the heights of psyculture. It is a massive and\u00a0constantly shifting movement, with elements leading\u00a0in different directions and\u00a0new scenes and regional scenes emerging and changing all the time. I have\u00a0attempted to document\u00a0something of this diversity in the book. Single events\u00a0are characteristic of this diversity. There are also many free or by donation\u00a0parties that happen in most cosmopolitan centres and their hinterlands like\u00a0around Melbourne. Large festivals that charge for\u00a0entrance, like Boom, offer\u00a0freedoms to experiment, express and explore alternatives in ways that small\u00a0events that may be free of\u00a0charge do not. Are such events not also free\u00a0cultural spaces, since they are cultural spaces that promote freedoms? \r\n \r\nAll that said I recently saw how psytrance is getting\u00a0showcased at multi-genre events like the Boomtown Fair in the UK, where\u00a0those\u00a0who can afford the 170 quid ticket become exposed to a condensed simulacra of\u00a0the scene. In this contrivance, mega and\u00a0crossover events, like Boomtown,\u00a0appear to host EDM spaces as relatively self-contained stylistic worlds.\u00a0Perhaps the promo for\u00a0such an event could be "HavewegotPsytrancefor\u00a0you!" I'm playing with the phrase "Havewegotavacationfor\u00a0you!", the slogan\u00a0from Delos, the promoters of themed worlds for high-end\u00a0customers, including Westworld<\/em>, in Michael Crichton's Sci Fi novel by\u00a0that\u00a0name, adapted for the 1973 MGM film...\u00a0\u00a0But\u00a0then it might be really cool to oscillate between Psyworld and Dubworld. \r\n \r\nOver the years, many have tried to politicise the\u00a0movement. In retrospect, can we say that this is failed project because the\u00a0participants were more interested in their private transitional experience? In\u00a0many cultures spiritual border experiences through\u00a0music, dance and drugs is\u00a0controversial enough. Wouldn't it make more sense to emphasize the underground\u00a0aspect of Psytrance?\u00a0To politicise the movement, to make it more public, and\u00a0democratize its intentions, always runs the risk of instrumentalization\u2014and\u00a0eventually disappointment.<\/strong> \r\n \r\nYou may hold to a narrow version of \u201cpolitics\u201d that I\u00a0don\u2019t share. In my previous book\u00a0Technomad:\u00a0Global Raving\u00a0Countercultures<\/em>, I\u00a0tried to outline a theory of resistance that grew out of studies of EDM\u00a0cultures which I called \u201chyper-responsibility.\u201d That is, I saw that\u00a0techno-tribes across EDM genres mount vibes (socio-sonic aesthetics) that are\u00a0characterised by\u00a0a spectrum of responses to the conditions of the present among\u00a0its practitioners. Events are vehicles for differential freedoms\u00a0from a range\u00a0of conditions experienced by participants. They may be opportunities for\u00a0transgression, or personal liberations, and\u00a0they may be platforms for\u00a0reactionary or progressive movements whose goals lie beyond the dancefloor.\u00a0Psychedelic trance\u00a0possesses this hyper-responsiveness. In some cases, the\u00a0simple act of holding a party within repressive social and political\u00a0climates\u00a0is a definite political accomplishment. Expressing one\u2019s commitment towards\u00a0cognitive freedom in a global climate of\u00a0repressive drug legislation are\u00a0actions that should be recognised as political. In other cases holding events\u00a0in times of social\u00a0transformation \u2013 early Goa parties in Germany for example -\u00a0furnishes events with a revolutionary sensibility. \r\n \r\nIn Global Tribe you have not focused on an analysis of\u00a0the music. Can you do that for us and describe, in detail, one of your\u00a0favourite tracks of psytrance? What's the sound, the vibe, of psytrance? What\u00a0do you hear that we do not experience?<\/strong> \r\n \r\nYes, the music does not receive analysis in the fashion\u00a0that would be treated, for instance, by a musicologist or a music\u00a0historian.\u00a0But then again, musicologists have a habit of squeezing the life from cultural\u00a0experience in overly technical analyses.\u00a0What you\u2019re getting is what is stated\u00a0on the tin \u2013 i.e., the book is not music history or music criticism. \r\n \r\nI provide here, however, a basic description of the Goa\u00a0Trance sound from which psychedelic trance and its various subgenre\u00a0developments\u00a0are indebted. This description was put together with the help of Toni\u00a0Aittoniemi who recently completed an MA on\u00a0the \u201cCultural and Musical\u00a0Dimensions of Goa Trance and Early Psychedelic Trance in Finland\u201d:\u00a0https:\/\/helda.helsinki.fi\/handle\/10138\/34536<\/a>.\u00a0(This description could be expanded and music criticism applied to this and\u00a0subsequent developments). \r\n \r\nAlthough the sound, which emerged\u00a0by 1994 as a marketable genre, received great variation according to stylistic\u00a0 influences,\u00a0fusional developments, and regional aesthetics, there emerged a\u00a0\u2018classic\u2019 Goa Trance style led by a strong four quarter-note kick\u00a0drum pattern\u00a0in 4\/4, with a more or less constant accentuation of the 16th-note layer at\u00a0bpm\u2019s between 130\u2013150. \r\n<\/p>\r\n  \r\nProminent\u00a0early artists experimented with analogue sound\u00a0sources, digital and hybrid synthesizers, samplers and digital drum machines to\u00a0build evolving patterns with layered synth sounds and sub-bass frequencies in\u00a0hypnotic arrangements. Artists used MIDI\u00a0(Multiple Instrument Digital\u00a0Interface), computers, and software. Among the most familiar sounds were the\u00a0fast arpeggio-patterns\u00a0and strong sawtooth-wave leads running through a\u00a0resonant band-pass or high-pass filter, such as found in the work of Astral\u00a0Projection and Etnica. Early works employed additive rhythmic characteristics\u00a0in the bassline, like the Latin-American\u00a0tresillo\u00a0(the\u00a0duple-pulse rhythmic cell)\u00a0or variations of \u201coriental\u00a0patterns.\u201d While syncopation receded in later developments, intricate\u00a0triple-meter accenting embedded in a \u201cstraight\u201d duple-framework persisted in\u00a0the higher frequency layers, arpeggios, percussive\u00a0elements and leads. These\u00a0embedded alternative signatures combined with the frequent use of the Phrygian\u00a0Major scale to give\u00a0Goa Trance an \u201cEastern\u201d feel. The tracks were programmed\u00a0into 8-10 minute long pieces. \r\n \r\nIs some of this music online?\u00a0Can you give some pointers? Compilations are important, I understood. The album\u00a0was never the\u00a0right format for this type of music. Can you mention a few more\u00a0\u2018classic\u2019 tracks that you like? We\u2019re now 20-30 years later. How\u00a0would you\u00a0describe the style and the \u2018feel\u2019 of the music?<\/strong> \r\n \r\nNetlabels\u00a0have grown popular here as in other EDM developments. One chief portal (and\u00a0label) is Ektoplazm<\/a>\u00a0 (www.ektoplazm.com) founded by Alexander Synaptic (Basilisk). That site\u00a0incidentally features a spectrum of psychedelic\u00a0electronic music, where the\u00a0term \u201cpsytrance\u201d holds much less explanatory power than it once did. A \u201cone\u00a0stop shop\u201d (it's a free\u00a0download) can land you the epic\u00a0Ektoplazm's Greatest\u00a0Trips<\/a>, 50 tracks from 2008-2012 compiled by Basilisk showcasing \u201cthe\u00a0immense diversity and creative vitality of the global psychedelic trance, techno,\u00a0and downtempo movements.\u201d\r\n<\/p>\r\n  \r\nAlbums and\u00a0EPs (in digital files) continue to be a chief means by which artists will make\u00a0a name for themselves, alongside\u00a0Soundcloud, and there is prestige to being\u00a0selected on label compilations, and ultimately selected by touring DJs.\u00a0Expressing\u00a0artistic vision in concept albums appears retained in this\u00a0development, inheriting much from psychedelic forebears, although the\u00a0\u201cvision\u201d\u00a0is somewhat distributed as artists can take on a variety of personas and be\u00a0involved with numerous acts, in response to\u00a0changing styles and tastes. In many\u00a0cases, the overall vision seems to be retained, as with the prodigious output\u00a0of Jake\u00a0Stephenson (aka Shamanic Tribes on Acid \u2013 i.e. STONA) who was involved\u00a0in, from the last count at Discogs, some 58 named\u00a0production projects. The\u00a0industry characteristics of this development deserve greater attention, including\u00a0how many DJ\/producer\u00a0names in the psychedelic tradition are more than just\u00a0names, but invented personas. \r\n \r\n\u201cClassic\u201d\u00a0covers quite some territory for me and I could go on for pages, but from a\u00a0mid-1990s era perspective I'll be mercifully\u00a0brief - besides Hallucinogen\u00a0(Simon Posford) who was responsible for shaping the sound of psychedelic trance\u00a0with many classic\u00a0tracks like anything from\u00a0The Lone Deranger<\/em>, as well\u00a0as tracks like \u201cSpace Pussy\u201d and \u201cLSD\u201d (Posford is also the chief engineer\u00a0behind chief act in the psychedelic diaspora Sphongle (with Raja Ram), I like\u00a0early X-Dream, Earth Nation, Total Eclipse, Astral\u00a0Projection, Etnica, Eat\u00a0Static, System 7, Third Eye, Human Blue, Synchro (on the psybreaks edge), and\u00a0UX, especially \u201cMaster of the\u00a0Universe\u201d which was dark and brooding and\u00a0thunderous psychedelic opera, and ahead of its time (their album\u00a0Ultimate\u00a0Experience<\/em>\u00a0(1997) was recently remastered to superb effect). \r\n<\/p>\r\n  \r\nUltimately I\u00a0cannot nail it down to any one sound. But as far as the\u00a0music is concerned,\u00a0it's all about the context \u2013 i.e. the dancefloor and the event itself. You\u00a0cannot understand this music, nor\u00a0indeed most EDM sounds, through your\u00a0headphones at home or in the car. It's truly experienced as shared vibrating\u00a0rhythms in\u00a0fully optimised social dance contexts. In my experience, the most\u00a0optimised environment for this experience is the Dance Temple\u00a0(i.e the main\u00a0dancefloor) at the Boom Festival. \r\n \r\nWhat do you make of Simon Reynolds' retromania thesis?\u00a0Psytrance is not precisely retro. If anything it could be labelled as\u00a0\u20181990s\u00a0music\u2019. Still, all the retrogarde aspect of the contemporary recording industry\u00a0affect psytrance as well.<\/strong> \r\n \r\nI haven't read\u00a0Retromania<\/em>. I agree that there\u00a0remains a core Goa sensibility motoring this development across generations, a\u00a0whole gestalt and marketable format that was crafted in the 1990s to simulate\u00a0the seasonal DJ-led full moon beach party\u00a0interzone of the 1980s, which itself\u00a0built upon the cosmic throw downs of the 1970s \u2013 and which were originally and over\u00a025\u00a0seasons subject to the influx of styles and techniques from scenes all over\u00a0the world. \r\n<\/p>\r\n  \r\nThe bandwidth of this stylistic profusion may\u00a0have been narrowed at\u00a0the advent of a music marketed as Goa Trance (e.g. care of Dragonfly Records)\u00a0but today's events,\u00a0especially the larger festivals downstream from this\u00a0heritage are diverse, partly because they continue to be influenced by new\u00a0trends, including as mentioned, the dark sensibility, but also dubstep, and\u00a0progressive developments. And yet, when I entered the\u00a0chill space on the\u00a0Thursday night at the 2013 edition of the Ozora festival in Hungary, I might\u00a0have been transported back to\u00a0Anjuna beach in 1974 at the height of the full\u00a0moon. This is among the most impressive chill spaces anywhere, and Solar Fields\u00a0was coming on - good timing as I joined the buzz inside a giant beehive. Over\u00a0the next two hours a convulsive crowd orgasm\u00a0achieved peak after peak. Ambient\u00a0electronica has remained integral to psyculture and has been a chief aesthetic\u00a0in the\u00a0psychedelic continuum, since the early Goa period and highly optimised\u00a0chill spaces carry the event-cultural heritage as much as\u00a0main floors. \r\n \r\nIs it possible to compare or to contrast the Psytrance\u00a0with the Global Justice Movement (Seattle, Genova) and the recent\u00a0occupations\u00a0such as in Tel Aviv, Tahir, Occupy Wall Street and Taksim, also known as the\u00a0Movements of the Squares? The aspect of\u00a0gathering seems very important, you\u00a0stress this time and again.<\/strong> \r\n \r\nVery different kinds of events, and my return question\u00a0to you would be: is a favourable comparison required for psyculture\u00a0events to\u00a0be considered worthy of attention? Based on narrow perceptions of political\u00a0behaviour, possibly not. But then I do not\u00a0hold to a narrow perception of the\u00a0\u201cpolitical.\u201d It could be argued that psyculture and visionary arts events\u00a0represent the pinnacle\u00a0achievement of freedom at the other end of the\u00a0revolution, enabled by liberal democracies with a healthy middle class and high\u00a0standards of living. Over time, the experience filters through to those\u00a0populations who do not match the privileged status of their\u00a0forebears. \r\n \r\nCan psyculture events be the means of revolution? Possibly\u00a0not in terms of being confrontational or \u2018protestival\u2019 events, but this\u00a0has not\u00a0stopped events like Boom from adopting radical social and cultural agendas. In\u00a0fact, like Burning Man, Boom and other\u00a0events have developed as platforms for\u00a0change by hosting spaces in which a range of ecological, alter-globalization\u00a0and wellbeing\u00a0causes are showcased, modelled by and transmitted to its\u00a0participating populations and regional communities. \r\n<\/p>\r\n  \r\nThe way an event is\u00a0organised, or indeed self-organised as in the case of Burning Man, which holds\u00a0to a set of principles that highlight participation,\u00a0gifting, self\u2013reliance\u00a0etc., is itself the revolution in action. But I want to come back to something\u00a0that is overlooked constantly in\u00a0these kinds of comparisons and by people who\u00a0insist on measuring the value of psycultural and visionary arts events against\u00a0the\u00a0Occupy movement and more recent revolutionary protest movements. Being\u00a0altered together in\u00a0dance, either\u00a0with your\u00a0neighbours in small gatherings close to home, or in an experience\u00a0shared with thousands from a hundred different countries (as\u00a0is the case at\u00a0Boom\u2019s Dance Temple) is significant on its own and does not need to be measured\u00a0against other forms of gathering. \r\n \r\nWhat are you working on right now? Is my desire for a\u00a0comprehensive history of Goa-trance (as you have described in\u00a0chapter one)\u00a0justified? I seem to recall that you have not been to Goa yourself.<\/strong> \r\n \r\nNo, I haven't been to Goa.\u00a0Global Tribe<\/em>\u00a0is a post Goa\u00a0project, addressing the emergence and culture of festivals that arose in the\u00a0slipstream of Goa. I would also point out that, as far as I am aware,\u00a0researchers of Goa music scenes haven't been to Goa either, at\u00a0least not Goa\u00a0pre-1993 which is the year that key participants argue marked the end of the\u00a0momentous seasonal and\u00a0experimental trance dance era before the whole thing\u00a0imploded and exploded (i.e. was transposed internationally in the form of\u00a0music\u00a0aesthetics and event-cultures). A comprehensive history of Goatrance is not\u00a0unjustified \u2013 I'm waiting to see it myself;\u00a0possibly produced by someone\u00a0involved in that music scene through its development. In addition to that, it\u00a0would be great to read\u00a0a history of Goa seasonal party culture, pre Goatrance\u00a0(i.e 1960s-1980s). A history of the DAT and how the beach found its own\u00a0uses\u00a0for technology would also be fascinating. \r\n \r\nOne of the projects I'm involved in at present is a study of\u00a0the Burning Man diaspora in Europe and elsewhere, a project which\u00a0retains my\u00a0interest in global event-cultural movements. With a global network of burners\u00a0forming their own events in regions\u00a0worldwide, the world's largest temporary\u00a0city, Black Rock City, now has considerable reach and appeal worldwide, with\u00a0regional\u00a0events all over the world. It\u2019s a phenomenon warranting attention.\r\n<\/p>\r\n  \r\n \r\n<\/p>\r\n  \r\nThis interview originally appeared on the\u00a0Nettime<\/a>\u00a0mailing list.<\/em>\r\n<\/p>\r\n  \r\n\u00a0Image by<\/em> laurens28<\/a>, courtesy of Creative Commons license.\u00a0<\/em>\r\n<\/p>\r\n  \r\n \r\n<\/p>\r\n",

Offering a torrent of mind-expanding ideas and information, THE LOTTERY OF BIRTH is going to make you think again about what it means to be free. \r\n \r\nIn this live video discussion<\/a>, writer\/co-director Raoul Martinez will explore the provocative issues raised by the film, his experience making it, and his vision of the complete trilogy of films of which LOTTERY is the first part. This 60 minute webinar will start with a presentation by Raoul, followed by a lively Q&A. You will be part of the conversation, asking your questions on camera, like on a Skype call.\u00a0 \r\n \r\nDrawing on the best minds in philosophy, history, psychology, physics and economics -- including a stellar cast of interviewees from Noam Chomsky, Howard Zinn and Vandana Shiva to Steven Pinker, Daniel Dennett and Tony Benn -- the film employs decades of evidence to interrogate what we are, where we are and where we want to be.  \r\n \r\nFrom birth onwards our minds are a battleground of competing forces. The outcome of this battle determines the society we create. This is a film about the cultural, educational, political and commercial forces that shape our identities, often in ways that limit both our personal and political freedom. Whether you are into philosophy, economics or simply being a better person than you were born to be, you can\u2019t afford to miss this film. \r\n \r\nBrought to you by Mangu.tv<\/a>\r\nTHE LOTTERY OF BIRTH was nominated for Best Documentary at Raindance Film festival and won the Artivist Spirit award in LA. It was produced by Mangu.tv.  \r\n \r\nParticipants in this webinar receive a ticket to an online viewing of THE LOTTERY OF BIRTH, which you can view at any time from the moment of purchase until the live, online discussion on September 17. \r\n<\/div>\r\n \r\n \r\nClick here for more information.<\/a>\u00a0\u00a0\r\n<\/div>\r\n",

      "post_content": " \r\n \r\nAustralian cultural critic Graham St. John has written a\u00a0groundbreaking study on the way\u00a0the\u00a0electronic dance music (EDM) genre\u00a0called\u00a0Goatrance\u00a0globalized itself as a movement.\u00a0In\u00a0Global\u00a0Tribe: Technology, Spirituality and Psytrance<\/em>\u00a0 (Equinox, 2012), he\u00a0describes Goatrance not merely\u00a0as\u00a0a subcategory of EDM. Psytrance, as\u00a0it is also called,\u00a0is first and foremost a\u00a0culture\u00a0that is\u00a0celebrated\u00a0through events such as parties and festivals. The emphasis here is not on\u00a0regular clubs or labels but on personal\u00a0transformation which is celebrated in a\u00a0collective fashion. \r\n<\/p>\r\n  \r\nMusic\u00a0has a supportive role here, it is\u00a0literally\u00a0a medium, a\u00a0transportative\u00a0vehicle to carry us into another realm of consciousness. As Graham points out in the intro, \u201cEnabling\u00a0departures\u00a0from dominant codes of practice and arrivals at alternative modes of\u00a0being, the dance floor and the community proliferating\u00a0around its verges, are\u00a0built according to the design of a radical utopian imagination.\u201d The traveller-scholar\u00a0St. John has given\u00a0himself the task to articulate, theorize and popularize that\u00a0imagination. Because of the \u2018serving\u2019 task of the music, music criticism\u00a0plays less of a role in this case. \r\n \r\nIf anything, Graham St. John is a Critic of the Cosmic Event.\u00a0I\u2019d love to see him as a contemporary organic intellectual (as Gramsci\u00a0defined\u00a0it) of the psytrance movement. His intimate knowledge of the festivals and\u00a0their \u2018architechtonics of transition\u2019 has put\u00a0Graham St. John at odds with\u00a0traditional (Anglo-Saxon) academia that has a hard time understanding underground cultures which\u00a0position themselves outside of\u00a0the\u00a0pop mainstream.\u00a0\r\n<\/p>\r\n  \r\nAlthough he is passionate about music, Graham St John is not a musicologist.\u00a0He\u00a0is\u00a0a\u00a0chronologist\u00a0of the movement that records and reflects on spiritual cultures. He shies away\u00a0from\u00a0taking\u00a0up the role of the\u00a0ideologist. He is not the type of guy who describes what is\u00a0on the other side of the \u2018doors of perception\u2019 such as Kesey, Leary,\u00a0McKenna\u00a0and others. In 2003 we were colleagues at the Brisbane Centre for Critical and\u00a0Cultural Studies under Graeme Turner.\u00a0In the years after we managed to meet up\u00a0several times and stayed in contact, for instance over the Dancecult journal\u00a0and list that\u00a0 Graham co-founded. The launch of this major chronology of the\u00a0movement seemed the right moment to do an interview. \r\n \r\nAfter an introduction that maps out transnational\u00a0psycultures,\u00a0Global Tribe<\/em> takes us back to the\u00a0unruly 1970s and 1980s when\u00a0hippies the world over embarked for Goa (India) to\u00a0camp out on Anjuna Beach,\u00a0make music\u00a0and dance. It\u00a0 was\u00a0around the mid-80s\u00a0that a distinct\u00a0DJ-led\u00a0dance\u00a0culture\u00a0emerged\u00a0in Goa,\u00a0produced by travelling DJs\u00a0who brought\u00a0 cassettes, DAT tapes and later CDs. \r\n<\/p>\r\n  \r\nIn\u00a0the mid section of the book, Graham looks\u00a0at the darker sides of the psytrance experience, the \u2018spiritual technologies\u2019, and\u00a0describes the technoshamanism in part induced by psychedelic\u00a0drugs. A third part describes the \u2018carnival\u2019 aspect of\u00a0psychedelic\u00a0festivals and related visionary arts. We then dig into case studies\u00a0of festival scenes in Israel and Australia (where the events are\u00a0called\u00a0\u2018doofs\u2019). Throughout the study St. John comes back to his visits to Boom,\u00a0one of Europe\u2019s\u00a0 largest festivals, in Portugal, visited\u00a0by tens of\u00a0thousands, prompting the central question of Global Tribe<\/em>: what is the\u00a0sociality and sensuality of dance? \r\n \r\nGeert Lovink: In the book there are traces of your own\u00a0experience, but not all that many. You struggle to get recognition as an\u00a0academic scholar while at the same time you are also clearly part of this\u00a0spiritual trance movement. Do you also keep a diary? Are\u00a0there things you\u00a0hesitate to write about? Global Tribe<\/em> attempts to be an official history of the\u00a0exodus of the movement, post-Goa,\u00a0becoming a planetary phenomenon.<\/strong> \r\n \r\nGraham St John:\u00a0Global Tribe<\/em> is layered with my own experience in a style that\u00a0I believe is accessible, certainly by comparison to\u00a0most academic books. I\u2019ve\u00a0tried to produce a book that is accessible to those outside academia. This is\u00a0not an easy task, especially\u00a0given that those trained within the social\u00a0sciences do not normally possess advanced literary skills. And also, many of\u00a0those within\u00a0the wider movement population (the \u201cglobal tribe\u201d) are from\u00a0non-English backgrounds. And besides, it is notoriously difficult to\u00a0write\u00a0about the vibe from a \u201cscientific\u201d angle without coming across as a massive\u00a0douche nozzle. \r\n \r\nI\u2019m not as preoccupied with being recognised within academia\u00a0as you seem to infer. Most academics are politicians and\u00a0administrators working\u00a0in environments rewarding the greatest competitors and charlatans. I\u2019ve sought\u00a0to avoid this. Most of my\u00a0current work is in fact part of an effort to move\u00a0beyond the confines and limitations of academia. At this stage, I may not\u00a0publish\u00a0another academic book, as continuing exploitation by the academic\u00a0publishing industry is not a relationship I\u2019ve grown fond of. \r\n \r\nMy writing method is like the zone report technique. Given\u00a0that the experience of events is relatively temporary and not\u00a0uncommonly\u00a0intense, when I emerge from an event (party, festival, gathering\u2026) it has\u00a0usually been the case that I immerse myself\u00a0in writing. This has most often\u00a0been in the form of blogging, so my \u201cdiary\u201d as such becomes rather public and\u00a0also a great way of\u00a0soliciting feedback and ensuring accuracy. These blog\u00a0reports have often been the basis for later articles and book chapters. I\u00a0haven\u2019t done much lately, but a keep a blog at Blogspot<\/a>. \r\n \r\nAt\u00a0Dancecult: Journal of Electronic Dance Music Culture<\/em><\/a> (http:\/\/dj.dancecult.net)\u00a0we encourage\u00a0authors to write \u201czone\u201d style reports\u00a0with experimental stylistic and\u00a0experiential angles submitted to our From the Floor section. \r\n \r\nThere are things I hesitate to write about. This cultural\u00a0movement is permeated with ambiguity with relation to the law. Electronic\u00a0dance\u00a0music cultures are by their very nature outside or between the law, which can\u00a0be observed from a variety of angles \u2013 e.g.\u00a0unpermitted events, the use of\u00a0prohibited substances or the unlicensed mixing of controlled media content, an\u00a0experimentalism in\u00a0consumption and production practices that challenge laws,\u00a0regulations and codes. \r\n<\/p>\r\n  \r\nAny researcher needs to be careful in order to\u00a0protect\u00a0not only themselves but also their interlocutors and the events they write\u00a0about. That said, self-censoring everything one\u00a0does and says is anathema to\u00a0cutting edge research and writing. Finding artful techniques of representation\u00a0is a challenge, which\u00a0can be rewarding. In my own experience, blog reports and\u00a0subsequent articles and chapters are among efforts to push the\u00a0boundaries of\u00a0writing as method. See my recent article in\u00a0Dancecult\u00a0on \u201cwriting the\u00a0vibe<\/a>\u201d for instance, which remixed what I call\u00a0nanomedia\u00a0\u2013 fragments of\u00a0popular culture and media sources re-mediated and programmed by EDM producers\u00a0in music - as one\u00a0way to represent the vibe, i.e. perform the impossible (\u2028https:\/\/www104.griffith.edu.au\/index.php\/dancecult\/article\/view\/357\/362). \r\n \r\nDo you do prefer live pieces or can't we speak of a\u00a0distinction between live and pre-recorded? Do you believe in the perfect\u00a0sample?\u00a0\u00a0In your book you describe the\u00a0importance of live music that started off with the hours-long sessions of bands\u00a0like the\u00a0Grateful Dead. The schism you describe around the late seventies,\u00a0between the analogue, acoustic live jamming session on the Goa\u00a0beach and the\u00a0update of consumer electronics such as cassettes and DAT recording I find very\u00a0interesting in this respect.<\/strong> \r\n \r\nLiveness is a thoroughly contentious issue in EDM\u00a0performance and its study. I broached this in the book, but it\u2019s covered\u00a0more\u00a0comprehensively elsewhere. There will be those who argue for the genuine or\u00a0authentic nature of \u201clive\u201d performance, by\u00a0which is often meant bands or fusion\u00a0bands, using traditional instruments, e.g. a drum kit, but as has long been\u00a0recognised,\u00a0technics, from mixing desks to DJ performance software manipulated\u00a0on screen, from turntables to DAT, are instruments \u201cplayed\u201d\u00a0by musicians (i.e.\u00a0DJ\/producers). \r\n<\/p>\r\n  \r\nOf course, artists will establish varying degrees of competence\u00a0and skilfulness in techniques of\u00a0production and performance, but it has long\u00a0been recognised that production and performance are inseparable in EDM.\u00a0Ultimately DJ\/producers are playing an organic instrument that is\u00a0you\u00a0\u2013 i.e. your body on the dance floor,\u00a0and dancers are\u00a0 responding to an assemblage of factors, associated with a range\u00a0of sensory technologies optimised for a live experience. But DJs\u00a0aren\u2019t working\u00a0alone, which is one of the reasons why the question of liveness is often\u00a0wrongfooted. DJs collaborate with a\u00a0network of engineers and technicians,\u00a0visual artists, stage designers in any standard dance party or festival\u00a0environment, and how\u00a0well they do this is subject to ongoing internal debate\u00a0and discussion within scenes which seek to optimise and re-optimise these\u00a0relationships integral to EDM event-cultures. \r\n \r\nCan you also imagine a psytrance that would have gone in\u00a0a completely different direction, not electronic (techno) but for\u00a0instance more\u00a0influenced by world music? Can we say that the electronic element is essential\u00a0or is it rather accidental, a vehicle\u00a0for trance? In your book you emphasize\u00a0the centrality of dance. Dance comes\u00a0first, it brings you in the desired mood, the trance\u00a0(induced by drugs). The\u00a0music style comes second. What counts is the rhythm.<\/strong> \r\n \r\nFor some of those involved in the early full moon party\u00a0scene in Goa, which was a cosmic rock scene, they anticipated a\u00a0movement that\u00a0for them was thoroughly ruined by electronic music by the early 1980s. One of\u00a0the founders of the trance dance\u00a0music scene in Anjuna, Steve Devas, who\u00a0brought the first sound system to Anjuna in 1974, was enthusiastic at that time\u00a0about\u00a0what he called the \u201cCosmo Rock\u201d style which, as he stated to me and is\u00a0reproduced in the book, was \u201ca\u00a0potentially dynamic and\u00a0inspiring style of music to follow seventies UK and\u00a0California rock into an Indo-Hybrid new wave of rock music, that was to be\u00a0high,\u00a0lyrical and drivey with ethno world funk baselines to make for subtle and\u00a0sophisticated dance movements. In other words, music\u00a0for beach, sun and palm\u00a0trees and not cars, factories and mechanical big city urban landscapes\u201d. \r\n \r\nAs we know, by the mid 1980s, the performance of electronic\u00a0music (by DJs) had come to dominate these same full moon events\u00a0and their\u00a0subsequent developments. Electrosonic technics became integral to psychedelic\u00a0trance as it was to all other EDM\u00a0developments, from house to techno. What\u00a0became Goatrance and psychedelic trance, which is as much a culture as it is\u00a0music, is\u00a0a phenomenon that was enabled by developments in electronic music\u00a0production and performance. \r\n<\/p>\r\n  \r\nAs key producers, label heads\u00a0and event management\u00a0in this movement will tell you, sound frequencies and scales were being\u00a0produced by synthesisers that\u00a0were not available with traditional instruments.\u00a0Besides this, it has been much easier and cheaper to organise and reproduce\u00a0events in remote regions like Goa or in many of the out of the way places in\u00a0which festivals and parties are held using DJs in the\u00a0place of bands. In Goa,\u00a0one DJ like DJ Laurent using a DAT player could be responsible for an 8-10 hour\u00a0set that was mind\u00a0blowing, as opposed to a series of bands with a lot of\u00a0equipment requiring more effort, money, energy and resources. \r\n<\/p>\r\n  \r\nToday\u2019s\u00a0festivals\u00a0are downstream from this efficiency and resourcefulness, although they have\u00a0become increasingly optimised with very\u00a0high production values, and diversified.\u00a0For instance, Portugal\u2019s Boom Festival features a fusion band stage\/dance\u00a0floor, in\u00a0conjunction with several other dancefloors, returning us in a way to\u00a0the earlier fusional environment of Goa, which is certainly a\u00a0success for Boom,\u00a0since it emerged as an effort to reproduce the Goa seasonal party experience\u00a0outside of Goa. \r\n \r\nCulturally you position the post-Goa Trance movement\u00a0across the globe as part of the 1990s post-Cold War movements\u00a0defined by their\u00a0cyberoptimism, spiritual renaissance and the collective rituals of transition\u00a0and consciousness experiences. Do\u00a0you think that this New Age style of events\u00a0has come to an end after the global financial crisis and the growth of (youth)\u00a0unemployment? After all, visiting a global festival does cost money, in\u00a0particular the travelling. You could estimate that the post-Goa-movement would\u00a0become more regional or even local.<\/strong> \r\n \r\nToday\u2019s events are diverse, which is a theme implicit to\u00a0the book, as it\u2019s a diversity that was there from the inception, and\u00a0which\u00a0remains, despite industry and aesthetic formulas. I wouldn't characterise\u00a0psychedelic trance or its event culture as New\u00a0Age, certainly not by any\u00a0standard measurements of \u201cNew Age.\u201d\u00a0 For\u00a0one thing, that term has grown empty of meaning in the\u00a0present, especially in\u00a0relation to events in which transpersonal experiences may be occasioned within\u00a0social contexts, i.e. that are\u00a0participatory and relational. Studies which\u00a0perceive spirituality as private and internalised don't tend to account for\u00a0this. \r\n<\/p>\r\n  \r\nWhat's\u00a0more, in studies of New Age phenomena there is little accounting\u00a0for the alteration of consciousness using psychoactivating or\u00a0psychointegrating\u00a0compounds from MDMA to LSD or DMT, etc. This is largely because the academic\u00a0study of what became\u00a0identified as New Age was overseen by public funded\u00a0intellectuals who avoided anything to do with illicit substances given the\u00a0moratorium on research associated with prohibition. But it\u2019s also simply the\u00a0case that most participants in this movement won\u2019t\u00a0identify as New Agers. As\u00a0mentioned, it\u2019s a complex development. Since the early 2000s we\u2019ve seen the\u00a0development of \u201cdark\u201d\u00a0styles of trance which now dominate the nightscapes of\u00a0festivals and which now even have exclusive festivals. Sometimes rather\u00a0brutal\u00a0in aesthetic, these styles are rooted in gothic sensibilities some of which\u00a0steer a great distance from the progressive and\u00a0holistic pretentions of\u00a0Goatrance. \r\n \r\nPsychedelic trance is first and foremost localised \u2013 around\u00a0the world scenes have developed and thrived in local regions. There is\u00a0no\u00a0question of it becoming regional \u2013 it already is. The recent re-emergence of\u00a0the scene publication\u00a0Trancers Guide to the\u00a0Galaxy<\/em>\u00a0reflects this, as the publication features scene reports from a\u00a0couple dozen countries where psychedelic trance thrives, 20 years\u00a0after its\u00a0initial development. This is despite the global financial crisis in recent\u00a0years. \r\n<\/p>\r\n  \r\nA focused study of psychedelic traveller-tourism might offer some\u00a0insights on this, but perhaps it is the case that times of crisis are followed\u00a0by a common desire to be\u00a0together, which in the case of psytrance as well as\u00a0other EDM scenes, is an ecstatic desire to\u00a0be\u00a0altered together, using a variety of\u00a0shared sensory technologies. This is\u00a0close to the argument made by Peter Shapiro in\u00a0Turn the Beat Around: The Secret History of\u00a0Disco<\/em>. EDM movements\u00a0have arisen in history and have exploded across the world, maintaining form or\u00a0mutating, in response to\u00a0present conditions of crisis. These dance movements\u00a0take a variety of forms, from the more legitimised with a corporatized style of\u00a0communitas to the more experimental and alternative. The greatest obstacle to\u00a0these developments remains state intervention,\u00a0onerous permit requirements,\u00a0police interventions, and ultimately I would argue, normalisation.\u00a0Event-cultures of this kind seek a\u00a0delicate balance between retaining\u00a0exclusivity and opening the doors.  \r\n \r\nCan you imagine that next movement will focus more on\u00a0the economics of the festivals and have a more egalitarian approach\u00a0in terms of\u00a0the redistribution of income? Can you tell us more about the controversies that\u00a0happen now and then between\u00a0mainstream organisers that ask entry fees for\u00a0festival and the more autonomous free events? The last one sounds more\u00a0idealistic\u00a0but in fact works contrary if you want to set up a more sustainable\u00a0economy. Can you\u00a0imagine that you will paid, one day, to be the movement's\u00a0organic intellectual? I see an urgency here.<\/strong> \r\n \r\nWell, I don\u2019t know about organic intellectual, but I\u00a0have been speaking at events for the last few years. There are a growing\u00a0number\u00a0of festivals that feature cultural programs with workshop and lecture programs\u00a0which have become rather professional\u00a0downstream from developments at the Boom\u00a0Festival in particular which features an excellent and formative area called\u00a0the\u00a0Liminal Village which has daily programs for a week including lectures and\u00a0films on a host of themes of importance to the\u00a0population of an event that now\u00a0averages about 25K. This is clearly more than just a dance music event and\u00a0psytrance is clearly\u00a0more than just about music. And Boom also hosts music\u00a0styles outside of psytrance. This is why I prefer to use the term\u00a0psyculture. \r\n \r\nThe 2013 Ozora Festival in Hungary is another example of a\u00a0major festival, identifying as a \u201cpsychedelic tribal gathering\u201d, which\u00a0features\u00a0a cultural program (in which I participated) and is striving to be more than a\u00a0dance festival. For instance, like Boom, and\u00a0Burning Man, it features a daily\u00a0newspaper. For the record, since you mentioned it, while some of these events\u00a0might pay, it\u2019s\u00a0rarely even enough to cover my own transport expenses. \r\n \r\nThere is a great deal of debate internal to this movement\u00a0over a range of developments, including the price of event tickets. But\u00a0there\u00a0is no simplified way to look at it, because there are many angles. A great many\u00a0people earn their livelihood trading their\u00a0services, arts, labours at these\u00a0events, offering their services and technical support to event management, as\u00a0well as trade goods\u00a0and services at festivals, some travelling in circuits all\u00a0year round. Others will volunteer their labour at events in exchange for\u00a0entry\u00a0and perhaps earn meal tickets. Others are given the opportunity to experiment\u00a0with new techniques or methods, for\u00a0instance, within healing arts or waste\u00a0management (e.g. bio-toilets and showers). Commercial festivals are diverse and\u00a0large scale\u00a0industries upon which many travellers and those living largely \u201coff\u00a0the grid\u201d are able to survive. Within the psychedelic\u00a0movement, the nature of\u00a0this commercialism is subject to constant scrutiny. For instance, corporate\u00a0sponsorship of events is\u00a0generally roundly criticised. \r\n \r\nThere is the critique of the 'mob-driven, hedonistic\u00a0numbness' of certain participants during big festivals. The massive\u00a0mainstream\u00a0character of the festivals is certainly something that is the case here in the\u00a0 Netherlands. Is the trend towards smaller,\u00a0more secretive happenings\u00a0inevitable? And do you find the critique of big festivals as spiritual\u00a0spectacles justified? Has\u00a0commercialism around 2007-2008 killed Psytrance?<\/strong> \r\n \r\nCommercialism has not killed psytrance, nor psyculture.\u00a0Scenes rely on commercialism to sustain a variety of industries upon\u00a0which a\u00a0vast network of people and communities rely for their survival. Most of all,\u00a0the musicians \u2013 i.e. the people who produce the\u00a0music upon which this industry\u00a0relies \u2013 need to make a return for their efforts which in a world of\u00a0file-sharing means live\u00a0appearances at ticketed events. \r\n<\/p>\r\n  \r\nThe reality is complex,\u00a0and always more complicated than any one person can know. I do not claim\u00a0to\u00a0hold a commanding view over the heights of psyculture. It is a massive and\u00a0constantly shifting movement, with elements leading\u00a0in different directions and\u00a0new scenes and regional scenes emerging and changing all the time. I have\u00a0attempted to document\u00a0something of this diversity in the book. Single events\u00a0are characteristic of this diversity. There are also many free or by donation\u00a0parties that happen in most cosmopolitan centres and their hinterlands like\u00a0around Melbourne. Large festivals that charge for\u00a0entrance, like Boom, offer\u00a0freedoms to experiment, express and explore alternatives in ways that small\u00a0events that may be free of\u00a0charge do not. Are such events not also free\u00a0cultural spaces, since they are cultural spaces that promote freedoms? \r\n \r\nAll that said I recently saw how psytrance is getting\u00a0showcased at multi-genre events like the Boomtown Fair in the UK, where\u00a0those\u00a0who can afford the 170 quid ticket become exposed to a condensed simulacra of\u00a0the scene. In this contrivance, mega and\u00a0crossover events, like Boomtown,\u00a0appear to host EDM spaces as relatively self-contained stylistic worlds.\u00a0Perhaps the promo for\u00a0such an event could be "HavewegotPsytrancefor\u00a0you!" I'm playing with the phrase "Havewegotavacationfor\u00a0you!", the slogan\u00a0from Delos, the promoters of themed worlds for high-end\u00a0customers, including Westworld<\/em>, in Michael Crichton's Sci Fi novel by\u00a0that\u00a0name, adapted for the 1973 MGM film...\u00a0\u00a0But\u00a0then it might be really cool to oscillate between Psyworld and Dubworld. \r\n \r\nOver the years, many have tried to politicise the\u00a0movement. In retrospect, can we say that this is failed project because the\u00a0participants were more interested in their private transitional experience? In\u00a0many cultures spiritual border experiences through\u00a0music, dance and drugs is\u00a0controversial enough. Wouldn't it make more sense to emphasize the underground\u00a0aspect of Psytrance?\u00a0To politicise the movement, to make it more public, and\u00a0democratize its intentions, always runs the risk of instrumentalization\u2014and\u00a0eventually disappointment.<\/strong> \r\n \r\nYou may hold to a narrow version of \u201cpolitics\u201d that I\u00a0don\u2019t share. In my previous book\u00a0Technomad:\u00a0Global Raving\u00a0Countercultures<\/em>, I\u00a0tried to outline a theory of resistance that grew out of studies of EDM\u00a0cultures which I called \u201chyper-responsibility.\u201d That is, I saw that\u00a0techno-tribes across EDM genres mount vibes (socio-sonic aesthetics) that are\u00a0characterised by\u00a0a spectrum of responses to the conditions of the present among\u00a0its practitioners. Events are vehicles for differential freedoms\u00a0from a range\u00a0of conditions experienced by participants. They may be opportunities for\u00a0transgression, or personal liberations, and\u00a0they may be platforms for\u00a0reactionary or progressive movements whose goals lie beyond the dancefloor.\u00a0Psychedelic trance\u00a0possesses this hyper-responsiveness. In some cases, the\u00a0simple act of holding a party within repressive social and political\u00a0climates\u00a0is a definite political accomplishment. Expressing one\u2019s commitment towards\u00a0cognitive freedom in a global climate of\u00a0repressive drug legislation are\u00a0actions that should be recognised as political. In other cases holding events\u00a0in times of social\u00a0transformation \u2013 early Goa parties in Germany for example -\u00a0furnishes events with a revolutionary sensibility. \r\n \r\nIn Global Tribe you have not focused on an analysis of\u00a0the music. Can you do that for us and describe, in detail, one of your\u00a0favourite tracks of psytrance? What's the sound, the vibe, of psytrance? What\u00a0do you hear that we do not experience?<\/strong> \r\n \r\nYes, the music does not receive analysis in the fashion\u00a0that would be treated, for instance, by a musicologist or a music\u00a0historian.\u00a0But then again, musicologists have a habit of squeezing the life from cultural\u00a0experience in overly technical analyses.\u00a0What you\u2019re getting is what is stated\u00a0on the tin \u2013 i.e., the book is not music history or music criticism. \r\n \r\nI provide here, however, a basic description of the Goa\u00a0Trance sound from which psychedelic trance and its various subgenre\u00a0developments\u00a0are indebted. This description was put together with the help of Toni\u00a0Aittoniemi who recently completed an MA on\u00a0the \u201cCultural and Musical\u00a0Dimensions of Goa Trance and Early Psychedelic Trance in Finland\u201d:\u00a0https:\/\/helda.helsinki.fi\/handle\/10138\/34536<\/a>.\u00a0(This description could be expanded and music criticism applied to this and\u00a0subsequent developments). \r\n \r\nAlthough the sound, which emerged\u00a0by 1994 as a marketable genre, received great variation according to stylistic\u00a0 influences,\u00a0fusional developments, and regional aesthetics, there emerged a\u00a0\u2018classic\u2019 Goa Trance style led by a strong four quarter-note kick\u00a0drum pattern\u00a0in 4\/4, with a more or less constant accentuation of the 16th-note layer at\u00a0bpm\u2019s between 130\u2013150. \r\n<\/p>\r\n  \r\nProminent\u00a0early artists experimented with analogue sound\u00a0sources, digital and hybrid synthesizers, samplers and digital drum machines to\u00a0build evolving patterns with layered synth sounds and sub-bass frequencies in\u00a0hypnotic arrangements. Artists used MIDI\u00a0(Multiple Instrument Digital\u00a0Interface), computers, and software. Among the most familiar sounds were the\u00a0fast arpeggio-patterns\u00a0and strong sawtooth-wave leads running through a\u00a0resonant band-pass or high-pass filter, such as found in the work of Astral\u00a0Projection and Etnica. Early works employed additive rhythmic characteristics\u00a0in the bassline, like the Latin-American\u00a0tresillo\u00a0(the\u00a0duple-pulse rhythmic cell)\u00a0or variations of \u201coriental\u00a0patterns.\u201d While syncopation receded in later developments, intricate\u00a0triple-meter accenting embedded in a \u201cstraight\u201d duple-framework persisted in\u00a0the higher frequency layers, arpeggios, percussive\u00a0elements and leads. These\u00a0embedded alternative signatures combined with the frequent use of the Phrygian\u00a0Major scale to give\u00a0Goa Trance an \u201cEastern\u201d feel. The tracks were programmed\u00a0into 8-10 minute long pieces. \r\n \r\nIs some of this music online?\u00a0Can you give some pointers? Compilations are important, I understood. The album\u00a0was never the\u00a0right format for this type of music. Can you mention a few more\u00a0\u2018classic\u2019 tracks that you like? We\u2019re now 20-30 years later. How\u00a0would you\u00a0describe the style and the \u2018feel\u2019 of the music?<\/strong> \r\n \r\nNetlabels\u00a0have grown popular here as in other EDM developments. One chief portal (and\u00a0label) is Ektoplazm<\/a>\u00a0 (www.ektoplazm.com) founded by Alexander Synaptic (Basilisk). That site\u00a0incidentally features a spectrum of psychedelic\u00a0electronic music, where the\u00a0term \u201cpsytrance\u201d holds much less explanatory power than it once did. A \u201cone\u00a0stop shop\u201d (it's a free\u00a0download) can land you the epic\u00a0Ektoplazm's Greatest\u00a0Trips<\/a>, 50 tracks from 2008-2012 compiled by Basilisk showcasing \u201cthe\u00a0immense diversity and creative vitality of the global psychedelic trance, techno,\u00a0and downtempo movements.\u201d\r\n<\/p>\r\n  \r\nAlbums and\u00a0EPs (in digital files) continue to be a chief means by which artists will make\u00a0a name for themselves, alongside\u00a0Soundcloud, and there is prestige to being\u00a0selected on label compilations, and ultimately selected by touring DJs.\u00a0Expressing\u00a0artistic vision in concept albums appears retained in this\u00a0development, inheriting much from psychedelic forebears, although the\u00a0\u201cvision\u201d\u00a0is somewhat distributed as artists can take on a variety of personas and be\u00a0involved with numerous acts, in response to\u00a0changing styles and tastes. In many\u00a0cases, the overall vision seems to be retained, as with the prodigious output\u00a0of Jake\u00a0Stephenson (aka Shamanic Tribes on Acid \u2013 i.e. STONA) who was involved\u00a0in, from the last count at Discogs, some 58 named\u00a0production projects. The\u00a0industry characteristics of this development deserve greater attention, including\u00a0how many DJ\/producer\u00a0names in the psychedelic tradition are more than just\u00a0names, but invented personas. \r\n \r\n\u201cClassic\u201d\u00a0covers quite some territory for me and I could go on for pages, but from a\u00a0mid-1990s era perspective I'll be mercifully\u00a0brief - besides Hallucinogen\u00a0(Simon Posford) who was responsible for shaping the sound of psychedelic trance\u00a0with many classic\u00a0tracks like anything from\u00a0The Lone Deranger<\/em>, as well\u00a0as tracks like \u201cSpace Pussy\u201d and \u201cLSD\u201d (Posford is also the chief engineer\u00a0behind chief act in the psychedelic diaspora Sphongle (with Raja Ram), I like\u00a0early X-Dream, Earth Nation, Total Eclipse, Astral\u00a0Projection, Etnica, Eat\u00a0Static, System 7, Third Eye, Human Blue, Synchro (on the psybreaks edge), and\u00a0UX, especially \u201cMaster of the\u00a0Universe\u201d which was dark and brooding and\u00a0thunderous psychedelic opera, and ahead of its time (their album\u00a0Ultimate\u00a0Experience<\/em>\u00a0(1997) was recently remastered to superb effect). \r\n<\/p>\r\n  \r\nUltimately I\u00a0cannot nail it down to any one sound. But as far as the\u00a0music is concerned,\u00a0it's all about the context \u2013 i.e. the dancefloor and the event itself. You\u00a0cannot understand this music, nor\u00a0indeed most EDM sounds, through your\u00a0headphones at home or in the car. It's truly experienced as shared vibrating\u00a0rhythms in\u00a0fully optimised social dance contexts. In my experience, the most\u00a0optimised environment for this experience is the Dance Temple\u00a0(i.e the main\u00a0dancefloor) at the Boom Festival. \r\n \r\nWhat do you make of Simon Reynolds' retromania thesis?\u00a0Psytrance is not precisely retro. If anything it could be labelled as\u00a0\u20181990s\u00a0music\u2019. Still, all the retrogarde aspect of the contemporary recording industry\u00a0affect psytrance as well.<\/strong> \r\n \r\nI haven't read\u00a0Retromania<\/em>. I agree that there\u00a0remains a core Goa sensibility motoring this development across generations, a\u00a0whole gestalt and marketable format that was crafted in the 1990s to simulate\u00a0the seasonal DJ-led full moon beach party\u00a0interzone of the 1980s, which itself\u00a0built upon the cosmic throw downs of the 1970s \u2013 and which were originally and over\u00a025\u00a0seasons subject to the influx of styles and techniques from scenes all over\u00a0the world. \r\n<\/p>\r\n  \r\nThe bandwidth of this stylistic profusion may\u00a0have been narrowed at\u00a0the advent of a music marketed as Goa Trance (e.g. care of Dragonfly Records)\u00a0but today's events,\u00a0especially the larger festivals downstream from this\u00a0heritage are diverse, partly because they continue to be influenced by new\u00a0trends, including as mentioned, the dark sensibility, but also dubstep, and\u00a0progressive developments. And yet, when I entered the\u00a0chill space on the\u00a0Thursday night at the 2013 edition of the Ozora festival in Hungary, I might\u00a0have been transported back to\u00a0Anjuna beach in 1974 at the height of the full\u00a0moon. This is among the most impressive chill spaces anywhere, and Solar Fields\u00a0was coming on - good timing as I joined the buzz inside a giant beehive. Over\u00a0the next two hours a convulsive crowd orgasm\u00a0achieved peak after peak. Ambient\u00a0electronica has remained integral to psyculture and has been a chief aesthetic\u00a0in the\u00a0psychedelic continuum, since the early Goa period and highly optimised\u00a0chill spaces carry the event-cultural heritage as much as\u00a0main floors. \r\n \r\nIs it possible to compare or to contrast the Psytrance\u00a0with the Global Justice Movement (Seattle, Genova) and the recent\u00a0occupations\u00a0such as in Tel Aviv, Tahir, Occupy Wall Street and Taksim, also known as the\u00a0Movements of the Squares? The aspect of\u00a0gathering seems very important, you\u00a0stress this time and again.<\/strong> \r\n \r\nVery different kinds of events, and my return question\u00a0to you would be: is a favourable comparison required for psyculture\u00a0events to\u00a0be considered worthy of attention? Based on narrow perceptions of political\u00a0behaviour, possibly not. But then I do not\u00a0hold to a narrow perception of the\u00a0\u201cpolitical.\u201d It could be argued that psyculture and visionary arts events\u00a0represent the pinnacle\u00a0achievement of freedom at the other end of the\u00a0revolution, enabled by liberal democracies with a healthy middle class and high\u00a0standards of living. Over time, the experience filters through to those\u00a0populations who do not match the privileged status of their\u00a0forebears. \r\n \r\nCan psyculture events be the means of revolution? Possibly\u00a0not in terms of being confrontational or \u2018protestival\u2019 events, but this\u00a0has not\u00a0stopped events like Boom from adopting radical social and cultural agendas. In\u00a0fact, like Burning Man, Boom and other\u00a0events have developed as platforms for\u00a0change by hosting spaces in which a range of ecological, alter-globalization\u00a0and wellbeing\u00a0causes are showcased, modelled by and transmitted to its\u00a0participating populations and regional communities. \r\n<\/p>\r\n  \r\nThe way an event is\u00a0organised, or indeed self-organised as in the case of Burning Man, which holds\u00a0to a set of principles that highlight participation,\u00a0gifting, self\u2013reliance\u00a0etc., is itself the revolution in action. But I want to come back to something\u00a0that is overlooked constantly in\u00a0these kinds of comparisons and by people who\u00a0insist on measuring the value of psycultural and visionary arts events against\u00a0the\u00a0Occupy movement and more recent revolutionary protest movements. Being\u00a0altered together in\u00a0dance, either\u00a0with your\u00a0neighbours in small gatherings close to home, or in an experience\u00a0shared with thousands from a hundred different countries (as\u00a0is the case at\u00a0Boom\u2019s Dance Temple) is significant on its own and does not need to be measured\u00a0against other forms of gathering. \r\n \r\nWhat are you working on right now? Is my desire for a\u00a0comprehensive history of Goa-trance (as you have described in\u00a0chapter one)\u00a0justified? I seem to recall that you have not been to Goa yourself.<\/strong> \r\n \r\nNo, I haven't been to Goa.\u00a0Global Tribe<\/em>\u00a0is a post Goa\u00a0project, addressing the emergence and culture of festivals that arose in the\u00a0slipstream of Goa. I would also point out that, as far as I am aware,\u00a0researchers of Goa music scenes haven't been to Goa either, at\u00a0least not Goa\u00a0pre-1993 which is the year that key participants argue marked the end of the\u00a0momentous seasonal and\u00a0experimental trance dance era before the whole thing\u00a0imploded and exploded (i.e. was transposed internationally in the form of\u00a0music\u00a0aesthetics and event-cultures). A comprehensive history of Goatrance is not\u00a0unjustified \u2013 I'm waiting to see it myself;\u00a0possibly produced by someone\u00a0involved in that music scene through its development. In addition to that, it\u00a0would be great to read\u00a0a history of Goa seasonal party culture, pre Goatrance\u00a0(i.e 1960s-1980s). A history of the DAT and how the beach found its own\u00a0uses\u00a0for technology would also be fascinating. \r\n \r\nOne of the projects I'm involved in at present is a study of\u00a0the Burning Man diaspora in Europe and elsewhere, a project which\u00a0retains my\u00a0interest in global event-cultural movements. With a global network of burners\u00a0forming their own events in regions\u00a0worldwide, the world's largest temporary\u00a0city, Black Rock City, now has considerable reach and appeal worldwide, with\u00a0regional\u00a0events all over the world. It\u2019s a phenomenon warranting attention.\r\n<\/p>\r\n  \r\n \r\n<\/p>\r\n  \r\nThis interview originally appeared on the\u00a0Nettime<\/a>\u00a0mailing list.<\/em>\r\n<\/p>\r\n  \r\n\u00a0Image by<\/em> laurens28<\/a>, courtesy of Creative Commons license.\u00a0<\/em>\r\n<\/p>\r\n  \r\n \r\n<\/p>\r\n",
