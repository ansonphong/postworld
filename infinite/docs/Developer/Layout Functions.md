# Layout Functions

The layout in Infinite is automatically generated. In this way, we are able to completely intercept the arbitrary standard Wordpress model, and configure our own structure for views.

Also for traditional WP developers, this also gives the flexibility to utilize the standard WP file structure if desired.

## Views Structure

The folder __/views__ contains the general views of the theme. Any directories and files inserted into the child theme will automatically over-ride the default theme.

## Page Render Structure

index.php >  
Detect post & page type > (archive, post type, view, etc)
